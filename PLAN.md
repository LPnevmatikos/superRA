# superRA Design Coherence Refactor — Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED DISCIPLINE: Use `superRA:handoff-doc` for all PLAN.md / RESULTS.md editing. This is plugin-development work, not a data-analysis vertical — `superRA:econ-data-analysis` does not apply. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking and cross-session handoff.

**Objective:** Consolidate superRA's design coherence per the design review. Eliminate stage-name drift, redundant restatements, hollow pointers, and orphaned skills. Tighten workflow boundaries. Slim the skill inventory.

**Methodology:** Per-skill edits to existing files (no new skills, two skills removed). Each task changes one concern and lands in one atomic commit (code + PLAN.md + RESULTS.md). Validation per task is end-to-end re-reading of every touched file plus targeted grep for orphan references. For any skill whose `description:` field is touched, run `superRA:writing-skills` triggering checks.

**Domain vertical:** Not data analysis. The `superRA:planning-workflow` Phase 1 Data Inventory hard gate does not apply — flagged explicitly. The implementer–reviewer pair, handoff-doc discipline, atomic-commit rule, and four workflow principles all carry over unchanged.

**Conventions:**
- One concern per task; one atomic commit per task.
- Use `Edit` (not `Write`) for surgical changes; preserve existing prose tone.
- After every task: re-read each touched file end-to-end; grep for orphan references to moved/removed content.
- Where a skill description changes, walk `superRA:writing-skills` triggering checks — descriptions are load-bearing for skill-discovery.
- Tasks may rewrite earlier-task steps in place if a finding changes the right approach for downstream work (the inline-edit rule).

**Output:** A refactored superRA plugin with:
- Stage names that match the manifest 1:1 (no fallbacks, no dispatch-time re-statements).
- Skill inventory reduced by 2 (`script-to-notebook` folded into `econ-data-analysis` references; `using-analysis-worktrees` folded into a broadened `worktree-data-sync`).
- `verification-before-completion` threaded into implementer/reviewer/orchestrator self-checks.
- Single source of truth for: User Decisions Log discipline, dispatch templates, four principles + autonomy, Stage→loads mapping.
- No restatement of manifest content in dispatch prompts.
- Project docs audit absorbed into the integration Stage 2 refactor/review loop (the doc-writer becomes RESULTS.md-only).

**Expected results:** Smaller, more coherent skill set. Cheaper agent loads (especially reviewer dispatches). Fewer drift surfaces. Same workflow behavior end-to-end.

**Pipeline:** No automated pipeline (this is a doc/skill refactor, not code). Per-task validation is manual: re-read affected files, grep for orphans. The closing Task (Final Consistency Pass) sweeps the whole repo to catch interactions.

**Pre-execution note:** The working directory `.git` is a stale worktree pointer (target path doesn't exist in the parent repo's `worktree list`). Repair before the first commit — either re-add the worktree from `/Users/zhiyufu/Dropbox/package_dev/econ-superpowers` with `git worktree add`, or convert this directory into a fresh clone / branch checkout. Until git works here, no commits land.

**Task sequencing note:** Tasks 1, 3, 4, and 6 are coupled. Sequence: **Task 1 → Task 4 → Task 3 → Task 6.**
- Task 1 establishes canonical Stage names + adds the `integration-review` manifest row (with current load contents preserved).
- Task 4 creates `econ-data-analysis/references/notebook-format.md` from script-to-notebook content.
- Task 3 slims `econ-data-analysis/SKILL.md`, creates `references/disciplines.md`, and absorbs the writing-discipline content into the now-existing `notebook-format.md` (Task 4 Step 1b finalizes the merge).
- Task 6 then sweeps the manifest: drops `handoff-doc` from most rows, applies the role-split for the `implementation` row's references created by Tasks 3 and 4.
Other tasks have no manifest dependency and may run in any order after Task 6.

### Task 1: Consolidate Stage names + remove dispatch re-statements
**Review status:** *(not started)*

**Files affected:** `skills/using-superRA/SKILL.md`, `skills/execution-workflow/SKILL.md`, `skills/integration-workflow/SKILL.md`, `skills/merge-workflow/SKILL.md`, `skills/semantic-merge/SKILL.md`, `skills/refactor-and-integrate/SKILL.md`, `agents/implementer.md`, `agents/reviewer.md`
**Input:** Current dispatch sites (grep targets below); current manifest (using-superRA §Skill-Load Manifest).
**Output:** Manifest is the single source of truth for Stage→{skills, references}. Every `Stage:` value in every dispatch matches a manifest row. Per-workflow `Skills:` / `Domain reference:` / "Agent Types and Domain References" tables are deleted.

- [ ] **Step 1: Audit Stage names actually emitted.**
  ```bash
  grep -rn "Stage:" skills/ agents/ --include="*.md" \
    | grep -v "frontmatter\|description\|Stage column\|Stage-scoped"
  ```
  Produce a single list of distinct values. Expected to find at least: `implementation`, `implementation review`, `drift test creation`, `drift test`, `integration review`, `refactoring`, `documentation finalization (...)`, `merge`, `merge proposer`, `merge proposer (Tier 3)`, `integration`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Decide canonical names.** Use the existing six manifest rows and let `subagent_type` (implementer vs reviewer) carry the role split:
  - `implementation` (was: implementation, implementation review)
  - `refactoring` (was: refactoring)
  - `drift-test` (was: drift test creation, drift test) — note: hyphenated, matches manifest
  - `integration-review` — **new manifest row** (was: integration review). Required because integration review's reference set differs from `refactoring`. Add to the manifest.
  - `merge` (was: merge, merge proposer, merge proposer (Tier 3); Tier moves to `Additionally:`)
  - `documentation` (was: documentation finalization (...); the descriptive suffix moves to `Additionally:`)
  - `planning-review` (unchanged)

  Update `using-superRA` §Skill-Load Manifest to add the `integration-review` row and to remove the `Fallback rule` that points unknown stages at `implementation` defaults — replace with: "Unknown Stage values are a dispatch error; the agent halts and reports."

- [ ] **Step 3: Sweep all dispatch sites.** For each file in *Files affected*, rewrite each non-canonical `Stage:` value to its canonical name. Where the old name carried sub-context (Tier 3, "Stage 2 RESULTS.md + project doc audit"), move that context into the `Additionally:` line.

- [ ] **Step 4: Delete redundant `Skills:` / `Domain reference(s):` lines from every dispatch template.** These re-state what the manifest now fully specifies. Keep `Skills:` only where the dispatch genuinely overrides the manifest (today: none; if any survive, leave a comment explaining why). Touch:
  - `integration-workflow:128–150, 174–187, 195–209, 256–278, 322–340`
  - `merge-workflow:82–96, 105–117`
  - `semantic-merge:146–158, 163–175, 193–207`
  - `refactor-and-integrate:38–58` (the dispatch examples — replace with a one-line pointer at `agent-orchestration` §Dispatch Templates)

- [ ] **Step 5: Delete per-workflow Agent-Types tables.** Specifically `integration-workflow:431–438` ("Agent Types and Domain References" table). Replace with one line: "See `superRA:using-superRA` §Skill-Load Manifest." Audit the other workflow skills for similar tables and delete them too.

- [ ] **Step 6: Update agents/{implementer,reviewer}.md "Before You Start" steps 3 and 4.** Today they say "load any additional skills specified in your dispatch prompt" and "read the domain reference file specified in your dispatch prompt." After this task, neither line should appear in dispatches. Rewrite step 3 to: "Load any additional skill the dispatch's `Additionally:` line names (rare — overrides only)." Delete step 4 entirely.

- [ ] **Step 7: Validate.** Re-grep `Stage:` and confirm every emitted value is in the manifest. Re-read every workflow skill end-to-end: dispatch templates should now be just `Stage:` + `Task:` (+ `Git range:` for reviewers) + `Additionally:`. Grep for `Skills:` and `Domain reference` in dispatch sections — should return only the manifest itself. Update PLAN.md (mark steps `[x]`, set Review status: IMPLEMENTED). Update RESULTS.md. Atomic commit.

---

### Task 2: Drop Agent Teams "recipe" framing
**Review status:** *(not started)*

**Files affected:** `skills/execution-workflow/SKILL.md`, `skills/integration-workflow/SKILL.md`, `skills/merge-workflow/SKILL.md`, `skills/semantic-merge/SKILL.md`, `skills/agent-orchestration/SKILL.md`, `skills/agent-orchestration/references/agent-teams.md`
**Input:** The four workflow skills' "Agent Teams Mode" sections.
**Output:** No skill claims a per-workflow team "recipe" exists. Spawn instructions live only in `agent-teams.md`; team composition is derived from the manifest.

- [ ] **Step 1: Remove "Invoke for the [X Team] recipe" lines** from each workflow's "Agent Teams Mode" section:
  - `execution-workflow:300` (Task Team recipe)
  - `integration-workflow:448` (Integration Team recipe — including the "6 teammates" enumeration)
  - `merge-workflow:196` (Merge Team recipe — including "4 teammates" + "7-task graph")
  - `semantic-merge:307` (Semantic Merge Team recipe)
  Replace each with one sentence: "When Agent Teams are available, see `agent-orchestration` §Integration and `references/agent-teams.md` for spawn mechanics. Composition is derived from the manifest — one teammate per stage this workflow runs."

- [ ] **Step 2: Update agent-orchestration §Integration** (lines 147–154). Today this lists each workflow with a one-line composition descriptor. Keep the list, but make it clear these are *what stages each workflow runs*, not "recipes." Suggested rewrite for each entry: "**superRA:integration-workflow** — runs stages: drift-test, refactoring, integration-review, documentation."

- [ ] **Step 3: Validate.** Grep for "recipe" across `skills/`. Should return only this PLAN.md and incidental usage. Re-read each workflow's "Agent Teams Mode" section — every section should defer to `agent-orchestration` for mechanics. Atomic commit.

### Task 3: Slim `econ-data-analysis/SKILL.md` (shared base) + extract one operational-disciplines reference
**Review status:** *(not started)*

**Files affected:** `skills/econ-data-analysis/SKILL.md`, `skills/econ-data-analysis/references/disciplines.md` (new — combined Describe + Analyze + Validate), `skills/econ-data-analysis/references/notebook-format.md` (Task 4 destination — absorbs writing-discipline content here), `skills/using-superRA/SKILL.md` (manifest), `agents/implementer.md`, `agents/reviewer.md`
**Input:** Current `econ-data-analysis/SKILL.md` (470 lines).
**Output:** Both implementer and reviewer load the same SKILL.md (~210 lines, down from 470) — the shared base with the §Review & Self-Check Discipline both walk, plus Pitfalls (reviewer needs it for operation review) and Red Flags. Implementer additionally loads ONE operational-disciplines reference (`disciplines.md`) carrying the deep DAV content. Reviewer loads SKILL.md only.

**Architectural design.** DAV (Describe / Analyze / Validate) are **concurrent disciplines** applied at every implementation step — splitting them into three reference files is overkill since the implementer always loads all three together. One combined reference is cleaner. The "Documentation — cross-cutting writing practice" section dissolves entirely: its conceptual one-liner moves into the SKILL.md three-disciplines intro; the writing mechanics (markdown cells when, inline comments when, figures pointer) move to `notebook-format.md` per Task 4 (its natural home — script-formatting + writing discipline are one concern); the per-step checklist deletes (it duplicates §Review & Self-Check Discipline gates).

| Section in current SKILL.md | Lines | Goes to | Loaded by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Iron Law | 15 | SKILL.md | both |
| Three Concurrent Disciplines intro (one para each, including "doc is concurrent") | 5 | SKILL.md | both |
| Describe + Analyze + Validate (full operational content) | 195 | `references/disciplines.md` | implementer |
| Documentation cross-cutting writing practice | 25 | (split: 1 line into SKILL.md intro; ~20 lines into `notebook-format.md` per Task 4; ~5 lines deleted as redundant with §Review checklist) | n/a |
| §Review & Self-Check Discipline (with `Why this matters` annotations) | 80 | SKILL.md | both walk it |
| Common Rationalizations | 15 | SKILL.md | both |
| Red Flags - STOP and Start Over | 15 | SKILL.md | both |
| Pitfalls (operation-specific catalog) | 60 | SKILL.md | both — reviewer needs it to verify merges, lags, aggregations, etc. |
| Key References | 5 | SKILL.md | both |

Result: SKILL.md ~210 lines. Reviewer load ~210. Implementer load ~210 + ~200 (`disciplines.md`) + `notebook-format.md` (also loaded per Task 4) ≈ same total as today's monolith, but split into two discoverable chunks (the discipline + the writing mechanics) instead of one 470-line wall.

- [ ] **Step 1: Create `references/disciplines.md`.** Combine the Describe, Analyze, and Validate sections from current SKILL.md into one reference file. Open with a 2-paragraph intro re-anchoring the reader in the Iron Law and the concurrent-disciplines framing (so the file reads coherently standalone). Preserve the `## Describe` / `## Analyze` / `## Validate` section structure and every existing subsection inside each (Describe's after-loading / before-merge / outliers / after-transformation / visualization; Analyze's row-count rule, sort discipline, join discipline; Validate's sanity / multi-source / missing-data / sensitivity).

- [ ] **Step 2: Dissolve the Documentation cross-cutting section.** From SKILL.md's "Documentation — cross-cutting writing practice" section:
  - Keep the one-line conceptual statement ("Documentation runs continuously alongside Describe, Analyze, and Validate") — fold into the new SKILL.md three-disciplines intro.
  - Move the §Writing discipline subsection (markdown cells / inline comments / figures pointer / major-vs-minor-decision rule) into `notebook-format.md` per Task 4. **Task 4 must absorb this content; sequencing note added in PLAN.md preamble.** Until Task 4 lands, stage the content as a draft block at the end of `notebook-format.md` if it's already created, or in a `notebook-format.md.draft` file if not.
  - Delete the §Short checklist per step — it duplicates the §Review & Self-Check Discipline gates (Markdown cell stating what / Row-count log / Decision justifications). Adding it once in the §Review checklist is enough.
  - Delete the §Script categories paragraph (analysis vs runner) — already covered by `notebook-format.md` per Task 4.

- [ ] **Step 3: Rewrite the slim SKILL.md.** New structure: Header + Stage-Scoped References (updated for the new layout) → Iron Law → Three Disciplines intro (one paragraph each — Describe / Analyze / Validate; the documentation concept folded into either the Analyze paragraph or a closing sentence; both end with "for the full operational discipline see `references/disciplines.md`; for writing mechanics see `references/notebook-format.md`") → §Review & Self-Check Discipline → Pitfalls → Common Rationalizations → Red Flags → Key References.

- [ ] **Step 4: Add `Why this matters` annotations** to §Review & Self-Check Discipline. Every `[GATING]` item gets a one-sentence rationale (e.g., for "Every input described before the first transformation": "Why: violations are silent corruption — the most common analytical error is transforming data you don't understand. See `references/disciplines.md` §Describe."). `[STANDARD]` items get rationale only where the item could be misapplied without context. `[ADVISORY]` items are bare. This is what protects against mechanical checklist-walking by reviewers — they understand *why* each gate exists.

- [ ] **Step 5: Update the manifest** (`using-superRA` §Skill-Load Manifest). For the `implementation` row, split the `Stage-scoped references` cell by role:
  - **Implementer:** `references/disciplines.md` + `references/notebook-format.md` (the latter from Task 4).
  - **Reviewer:** none beyond SKILL.md. Pitfalls is in SKILL.md; the dispatcher may name a Pitfalls subsection in `Additionally:` for review focus on a specific operation, but no extra file load.

- [ ] **Step 6: Update agent files.**
  - `agents/implementer.md` step 2: "Load `econ-data-analysis/SKILL.md` plus `references/disciplines.md` and `references/notebook-format.md` per the manifest's `implementation` row for implementer."
  - `agents/reviewer.md` step 2: "Load `econ-data-analysis/SKILL.md` only. The §Review & Self-Check Discipline you walk lives in SKILL.md; Pitfalls for any operation under review is in SKILL.md. If your dispatch's `Additionally:` line names a specific Pitfalls focus, jump to it."

- [ ] **Step 7: Validate.** Re-read SKILL.md end-to-end — should read as a complete shared discipline (no cliffhangers; the §Review checklist annotations point at `disciplines.md` but the checklist itself is self-sufficient). Re-read `disciplines.md` end-to-end — should read as a coherent operational guide; the three sections flow naturally together (the concurrent-disciplines framing makes this intuitive, not jarring). Re-read `notebook-format.md` end-to-end — the absorbed writing-discipline content should sit naturally next to the script-format mechanics. Atomic commit.

### Task 4: Move `script-to-notebook` into `econ-data-analysis` as a reference
**Review status:** *(not started)*

**Files affected:** `skills/script-to-notebook/SKILL.md` (delete), `skills/script-to-notebook/references/*.md` (move), `skills/econ-data-analysis/references/notebook-format.md` (new), `skills/econ-data-analysis/references/jupytext-guide.md` (move), `skills/econ-data-analysis/references/julia-quarto-guide.md` (move), `skills/econ-data-analysis/SKILL.md`, `skills/using-superRA/SKILL.md`, `skills/CATEGORIES.md`, `README.md`, `agents/implementer.md`, `agents/reviewer.md`, all skills that mention `superRA:script-to-notebook`
**Input:** Current `script-to-notebook` skill + its two references.
**Output:** Notebook-formatting content lives under the data-analysis vertical. Standalone skill is removed. Skill inventory shrinks by one.

- [ ] **Step 1: Move content.** Move `skills/script-to-notebook/SKILL.md` → `skills/econ-data-analysis/references/notebook-format.md` (keep the body; trim the frontmatter to a one-line description). Move `skills/script-to-notebook/references/jupytext-guide.md` and `julia-quarto-guide.md` to `skills/econ-data-analysis/references/`.

- [ ] **Step 1b: Absorb the writing-discipline content from Task 3 Step 2.** The dissolved §Documentation cross-cutting writing practice section (markdown cells when, inline comments when, figures discipline, major-vs-minor-decision rule) lands in `notebook-format.md` here — script-formatting and writing discipline are one concern. Place it as a new "Writing Discipline" section after the cell-organization section in `notebook-format.md`. If Task 3 staged the content as `notebook-format.md.draft`, merge it in and delete the draft file.

- [ ] **Step 2: Delete the skill folder.** `git rm -r skills/script-to-notebook/`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Update `econ-data-analysis/SKILL.md`** §Stage-Scoped References table to add the new `notebook-format.md` entry. Update §Documentation cross-cutting to point at `references/notebook-format.md` (replace the `superRA:script-to-notebook` mentions). Note: Task 3 has already removed most of this section; this step finalizes the references-table entries.

- [ ] **Step 4: Update the manifest** (`using-superRA` §Skill-Load Manifest). The `implementation` row's reference cell currently mentions `superRA:script-to-notebook` parenthetically. Replace with `econ-data-analysis/references/notebook-format.md` (data-analysis vertical only).

- [ ] **Step 5: Sweep all references.**
  ```bash
  grep -rn "script-to-notebook\|superRA:script-to-notebook" skills/ agents/ commands/ README.md CLAUDE.md CATEGORIES.md
  ```
  Update every match to point at `econ-data-analysis/references/notebook-format.md` (or delete if the mention is now obsolete).

- [ ] **Step 6: Update inventory tables.** Remove `script-to-notebook` row from `using-superRA` §Skill Inventory and `skills/CATEGORIES.md` Utility table and `README.md` skill table.

- [ ] **Step 7: Validate.** Grep again for `script-to-notebook` — only this PLAN.md and incidental references should remain. Re-read `econ-data-analysis/SKILL.md` end-to-end. Atomic commit.

### Task 5: Cache project conventions in PLAN.md header
**Review status:** *(not started)*

**Files affected:** `skills/handoff-doc/references/plan-anatomy.md`, `skills/planning-workflow/SKILL.md`, `skills/planning-workflow/references/plan-template.md`, `skills/execution-workflow/SKILL.md`, `agents/implementer.md`, `agents/reviewer.md`
**Input:** Current "Before You Start" walk-up step in `agents/implementer.md` step 6 and `agents/reviewer.md` step 6; `execution-workflow` Step 1.3.
**Output:** Project conventions discovered by orchestrator walk-up land in a `## Project Conventions` section of `PLAN.md` (read-only for subagents). Subagents read this section first; on-demand re-walk is allowed but not required.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add `## Project Conventions` to plan anatomy.** In `plan-anatomy.md` §Header, insert a new top-level section between `Conventions:` and `Output:` (or extend the existing `Conventions:` field). Spec: "Populated by the orchestrator at planning-workflow Phase 3 and at execution-workflow Step 1.3. Lists each module-level `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `README.md` walked, with a one-paragraph summary of the conventions extracted. Subagents read this section instead of re-walking; if a section is missing, they may walk on-demand and report the omission."

- [ ] **Step 2: Update `planning-workflow` SKILL.md Phase 3** ("File Structure"). Add a sub-step: "Walk the directories the plan will touch. Populate `## Project Conventions` in PLAN.md with the extracted conventions before drafting tasks."

- [ ] **Step 3: Update `planning-workflow/references/plan-template.md`** with the new section, including a worked example for a module with a CLAUDE.md.

- [ ] **Step 4: Update `execution-workflow` Step 1.3** to read: "If `## Project Conventions` is empty or stale, walk and populate it now. If populated, skim and proceed."

- [ ] **Step 5: Update `agents/implementer.md` step 6 and `agents/reviewer.md` step 6.** Replace the mandatory walk-up with: "Read the `## Project Conventions` section of PLAN.md. The orchestrator already walked. If you need conventions not covered there (a directory the orchestrator missed, or a `README.md` in a data dir the orchestrator didn't open), walk on-demand and flag the omission in your status return so the orchestrator can update PLAN.md."

- [ ] **Step 6: Validate.** Re-read both agent files end-to-end. Re-read `plan-anatomy.md` and `plan-template.md`. Atomic commit.

### Task 6: Centralize agent-shared discipline in `using-superRA` (absorb handoff-doc essentials)
**Review status:** *(not started)*

**Files affected:** `skills/using-superRA/SKILL.md`, `skills/using-superRA/references/main-agent-autonomy.md` (new), `skills/using-superRA/references/session-bootstrap.md`, `skills/handoff-doc/SKILL.md` (trimmed), `agents/implementer.md`, `agents/reviewer.md`, `skills/execution-workflow/SKILL.md`, `skills/integration-workflow/SKILL.md`, `skills/merge-workflow/SKILL.md`, `skills/semantic-merge/SKILL.md`, `skills/using-superRA/SKILL.md` (manifest)
**Input:** Today, agents load BOTH `using-superRA` (for principles) AND `handoff-doc` (for doc discipline). Workflow skills restate the four principles inline. Autonomy / stop-points / banned-phrasings live only in `execution-workflow`. Result: implementer/reviewer dispatch loads ~120 lines of `handoff-doc` they could read once at the design-contract level.
**Output:** Implementer/reviewer load only `using-superRA` for cross-cutting design + handoff-doc agent essentials. `handoff-doc` becomes a doc-*creation* skill (loaded by `planning-workflow` and the Stage 2 doc-writer only). Workflow skills carry no principle restatements. Autonomy lives in a main-agent-only reference.

**Architectural principle (per researcher):** `using-superRA` is the design home — every agent reads it. Anything an implementer or reviewer needs to know that crosses skill boundaries (the four principles, the handoff-doc editing rules, the User Decisions Log format, the autonomy contract) lives in `using-superRA` directly or in its `references/`. Specialized skills become loaders for callers that need the *full* discipline (creating docs from scratch, orchestrating). Subagent dependencies shrink.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add §Handoff Doc Discipline to `using-superRA/SKILL.md`** (~35 lines, new section after §Universal Principles). Absorb from `handoff-doc/SKILL.md` the agent-runtime essentials:
  - The four document principles (latest-state-only, live-and-committed, task-block-structure, doc-is-the-record). §Universal Principles #2 ("Handoff docs are the auditable record …") already states the headline; this new section spells out the operational rules.
  - The inline-edit rule (one paragraph).
  - The stale-content checklist (5 bullets — what counts as stale, remove not strike-through).
  - The §User Decisions Log format (where: task-scoped vs `## Decisions`; format: 3-line blockquote with date / question / rationale; the "log before you act" rule).
  - Figure embedding pointer (one sentence: figures go in `results_attachments/`; full mechanics in `report-in-markdown/references/rich-content.md`).
  - Pointer to the `## Project Conventions` section (introduced by Task 5).
  - Pointer to `handoff-doc/references/plan-anatomy.md` and `results-anatomy.md` for full templates (only doc-creators need them).

- [ ] **Step 2: Trim `handoff-doc/SKILL.md`** to a doc-creation skill. What remains: the two-stage RESULTS.md lifecycle paragraph, the §Standalone use vs Multi-agent workflows note, pointers to anatomy references, and a top-line rerouting note: "Cross-cutting agent-runtime essentials (the four principles, inline-edit rule, User Decisions Log, figure embedding pointer) live in `using-superRA` §Handoff Doc Discipline. This skill is for doc *creation*: invoked by `planning-workflow` for new docs and by the Stage 2 doc-writer for RESULTS.md maturation." Target: shrink from 118 lines to ~50.

- [ ] **Step 3: Create `using-superRA/references/main-agent-autonomy.md`.** Move the body of `execution-workflow` §Autonomy and Stop Points (lines 267–289) into it. Generalize so it applies to every workflow phase, not just execution. Include: "proceed without asking" patterns, "stop and ask" classes (the three pause classes from §Universal Principles #4), banned phrasings ("Should I proceed?", "Want me to continue?", etc.). Top of file: "Loaded by the main agent at session start. Subagents inherit autonomy from their dispatch boundary; they do not load this."

- [ ] **Step 4: Hook the new reference into session-start.** Update `using-superRA/references/session-bootstrap.md` to instruct the main agent to load `main-agent-autonomy.md` after the cross-session detection checks.

- [ ] **Step 5: Update agent files (drop handoff-doc dependency for typical work).**
  - In `agents/implementer.md` step 1: replace "Load `superRA:handoff-doc` before reading or editing PLAN.md or RESULTS.md" with: "You already loaded `superRA:using-superRA` per your frontmatter — its §Handoff Doc Discipline carries the rules you need for editing PLAN.md / RESULTS.md (four principles, inline-edit rule, stale-content checklist, User Decisions Log format, figure embedding pointer). Load `superRA:handoff-doc` only if your task creates a new PLAN.md or RESULTS.md from scratch (rare for implementer)."
  - Same in `agents/reviewer.md` step 1.

- [ ] **Step 6: Update the manifest.** Drop `handoff-doc` from the `implementation`, `refactoring`, `drift-test`, `merge`, and `integration-review` rows' "Required skills" cells. Keep it in the `documentation` row (doc-writer creates the matured RESULTS.md and needs the full discipline) and in `planning-review` (planning agents need plan-anatomy). Add a column-header note: "Skills listed here are loaded *in addition to* `using-superRA`, which carries the cross-cutting agent essentials."

- [ ] **Step 7: Strip principle and User-Decisions restatements from workflow skills.** In each of `execution-workflow`, `integration-workflow`, `merge-workflow`, `semantic-merge`:
  - Replace any restatement of the four principles with: "See `using-superRA` §Universal Principles."
  - Strip the §Autonomy and Stop Points body from `execution-workflow` (now in main-agent-autonomy.md). Replace with: "Workflow stop points are listed below. The autonomy contract (proceed-without-asking patterns, stop-and-ask classes, banned phrasings) is in `using-superRA/references/main-agent-autonomy.md` — main-agent only." Then list only the workflow-specific stop points (no rationale).
  - Replace each "log per `handoff-doc` §User Decisions Log" pointer with "log per `using-superRA` §Handoff Doc Discipline §User Decisions Log." (Task 7 will sweep the remaining duplicate text around these pointers.)

- [ ] **Step 8: Validate.** Re-read `using-superRA/SKILL.md` end-to-end — it should now feel like the central design contract every agent shares (principles + handoff-doc discipline + role-cross-cutting rules). Re-read `handoff-doc/SKILL.md` — should feel like a doc-creation skill, not an everyday agent skill. Re-read `agents/implementer.md` and `agents/reviewer.md` — neither should require loading handoff-doc for typical work; both should point at using-superRA's new section for doc-editing rules. Grep "four principles" / "load-bearing principle" — restatements should appear only in `using-superRA` and `main-agent-autonomy.md`. Atomic commit.

### Task 7: Stop restating User Decisions Log discipline
**Review status:** *(not started)*

**Files affected:** every workflow skill + `agent-orchestration` + `semantic-merge` + `agents/{implementer,reviewer}.md`
**Input:** Current restatements scattered across `execution-workflow`, `integration-workflow`, `merge-workflow`, `semantic-merge`, `agent-orchestration` (each repeats some variant of "log per `handoff-doc` §User Decisions Log; the `ask-user-question-logger` hook will remind you"). After Task 6, the canonical home is `using-superRA` §Handoff Doc Discipline §User Decisions Log.
**Output:** Workflow skills carry only a one-line pointer. The hook-reminder text appears once.

- [ ] **Step 1: Audit.**
  ```bash
  grep -rn "User Decisions Log\|ask-user-question-logger" skills/ agents/
  ```
  Catalog every restatement.

- [ ] **Step 2: Move the hook-reminder text into `using-superRA` §Handoff Doc Discipline §User Decisions Log** (the section created in Task 6). One sentence: "The `ask-user-question-logger` PostToolUse hook reminds you to log after each `AskUserQuestion` call; if your harness doesn't expose the hook, set a TodoWrite reminder."

- [ ] **Step 3: Replace each restatement** in workflow skills with: "Log per `using-superRA` §Handoff Doc Discipline §User Decisions Log."

- [ ] **Step 4: Validate.** Re-grep. Only `using-superRA` should carry the discipline; everywhere else is a one-line pointer. Atomic commit.

### Task 8: Step 0b — explicit handoff to `planning-workflow` (no inline degradation)
**Review status:** *(not started)*

**Files affected:** `skills/execution-workflow/SKILL.md`, `skills/planning-workflow/SKILL.md`
**Input:** `execution-workflow` Step 0b (lines 122–141) — currently inlines "load planning-workflow + handoff-doc, create or finish-editing PLAN.md/RESULTS.md, satisfy domain-specific planning gate."
**Output:** When PLAN.md/RESULTS.md are missing or dirty, execution-workflow halts and explicitly invokes `planning-workflow` (which then runs its full Phase 1 / Phase 2 / Self-Review). No inline planning-workflow degradation.

- [ ] **Step 1: Rewrite Step 0b.** Replace the "Before any task dispatch: load planning-workflow and handoff-doc, create or finish-editing PLAN.md…" paragraph with: "If the check fails, halt execution-workflow and invoke `superRA:planning-workflow` to bootstrap the docs. Do not inline planning-workflow content here. Resume execution-workflow at Step 1 after planning-workflow completes (its own self-review and execution-handoff will return control here)."

- [ ] **Step 2: Update `planning-workflow` overview** to add: "May be invoked from `execution-workflow` Step 0b when an existing branch lacks committed PLAN.md/RESULTS.md. The bootstrap path is identical to a fresh start — no shortcut."

- [ ] **Step 3: Validate.** Re-read both skills end-to-end. Re-read the `Step 0b` flow: a missing PLAN should result in a clean planning-workflow handoff, not a Task-0 inline edit. Atomic commit.

### Task 9: Move project doc audit into integration Stage 2 (refactor + integration-review)
**Review status:** *(not started)*

**Files affected:** `skills/integration-workflow/SKILL.md`, `skills/refactor-and-integrate/references/codebase-integration.md`, `skills/refactor-and-integrate/SKILL.md`, `skills/handoff-doc/references/results-anatomy.md` (the §Transition to Stage 2 paragraph)
**Input:** `integration-workflow` Step 3 sub-part B (lines 300–311) — currently bundled into the doc-writer dispatch.
**Output:** Project doc audit (walk-up CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / README.md, update stale claims, create missing pairs) becomes a checklist item for the Stage 2 refactorer and a verification item for the Stage 2 integration reviewer. Step 3 doc-writer is RESULTS.md-only.

- [ ] **Step 1: Move the audit checklist** (the bullet list at `integration-workflow:304–311` describing what to update, what to leave alone, the CLAUDE.md+AGENTS.md symlink rule) into `refactor-and-integrate/references/codebase-integration.md` as a new "Project Doc Audit" section. This becomes part of the refactorer's discipline.

- [ ] **Step 2: Update `integration-workflow` Stage 2 dispatches.** Both refactorer dispatch (Stage 2 step 4a) and integration-reviewer dispatch (Stage 2 step 2) get a sub-bullet: "this stage also covers project doc audit per `codebase-integration.md` §Project Doc Audit." (The dispatch template doesn't expand the checklist — the agent loads `codebase-integration.md` per the manifest.)

- [ ] **Step 3: Update `integration-workflow` Step 3.** Remove sub-part B entirely. Step 3 becomes:
  - Sub-part A (RESULTS.md maturation by doc-writer; subdivided per Task 10).
  - Sub-part C (PLAN.md disposition by orchestrator) — unchanged.
  
  Update the doc-writer dispatch (Step 3 sub-part A) to drop "Audit project docs reachable from the diff…" from its sub-parts list.

- [ ] **Step 4: Update `integration-workflow` Step 3 process diagram and red flags.** Remove every reference to "sub-part B," "project doc audit," and the "doc-writer subagent does the doc audit" framing.

- [ ] **Step 5: Update `results-anatomy.md` §Transition to Stage 2** to remove the "The same doc-writer pass also audits project-level docs" sentence.

- [ ] **Step 6: Validate.** Grep for "sub-part B" and "project doc audit" — should appear only in `codebase-integration.md`. Re-read integration-workflow end-to-end: the workflow should now have Stage 2 (which absorbed B) and Step 3 (now smaller — just RESULTS.md + PLAN.md disposition). Atomic commit.

---

### Task 10: Subdivide RESULTS.md maturation into ordered, recoverable commits
**Review status:** *(not started)*

**Files affected:** `skills/integration-workflow/SKILL.md` (Step 3 sub-part A), `skills/report-in-markdown/references/final-form.md`
**Input:** `integration-workflow:282–298` — sub-part A currently bundles fact-check + restructure + figure materialization + relocation into one commit.
**Output:** Sub-part A is four ordered commits: (1) fact-check in place, (2) restructure in place, (3) materialize figures, (4) `git mv` to `RESULTS_DIR` + attachments. Each commit is independently recoverable.

- [ ] **Step 1: Update `final-form.md`** with the four-step ordering. Each step gets its own validation criterion (e.g., step 1: every cited number matches its source; step 2: no task numbering remains; step 3: every figure rendered as PNG and embedded with relative path; step 4: file relocated, attachments folder relocated, history preserved).

- [ ] **Step 2: Update `integration-workflow` Step 3 sub-part A** to dispatch the doc-writer with the four-step sequence and explicit "commit each separately" instruction. Suggested commit messages: `"results: fact-check Stage 2 RESULTS.md"`, `"results: restructure Stage 2 RESULTS.md to reader-facing"`, `"results: materialize figures into ${RESULTS_DIR}/attachments"`, `"results: relocate RESULTS.md to ${RESULTS_DIR}"`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Update the doc-writer's report format.** Status return should list which of the four sub-commits landed (so a session interruption mid-A is recoverable: the next dispatch starts at the first un-landed step).

- [ ] **Step 4: Validate.** Re-read sub-part A and `final-form.md`. Confirm a session-crash mid-A produces a partially-relocated tree that is still git-coherent. Atomic commit.

### Task 11: Skip post-merge integration review on Tier 1 clean merges
**Review status:** *(not started)*

**Files affected:** `skills/merge-workflow/SKILL.md`, `skills/semantic-merge/SKILL.md`
**Input:** `merge-workflow` Step 2 (post-merge verification) currently runs both drift tests AND a fresh integration reviewer unconditionally.
**Output:** When `semantic-merge` Step 1 returned Tier 1 (clean merge, no conflicts, drift tests passed inside semantic-merge), `merge-workflow` Step 2b is skipped. The skip is documented in the merge commit.

- [ ] **Step 1: Update `semantic-merge`'s return contract.** When invoked from `merge-workflow`, semantic-merge returns its tier classification + a one-line "did main introduce non-trivial code changes?" verdict. Add this to `semantic-merge` §Invocation Pattern (delegated mode) and §What to Report.

- [ ] **Step 2: Update `merge-workflow` Step 2.** Add a sub-step 2.0: "Read semantic-merge's tier classification. If Tier 1 (clean, no conflicts) AND the incoming diff did not touch any file in your analysis paths: skip Step 2b. Run Step 2a (drift tests on merged state) only."

- [ ] **Step 3: Document the skip.** When 2b is skipped, the merge commit message gets a trailer: `"Post-merge integration review skipped: Tier 1 clean merge, no analysis-path changes incoming."` This makes the saving auditable.

- [ ] **Step 4: Update `merge-workflow` §Why Both Drift Tests AND Integration Review Post-Merge.** Replace "always run both" with the conditional rule. Preserve the rationale for the non-Tier-1 case.

- [ ] **Step 5: Validate.** Re-read `merge-workflow` Step 2 end-to-end. The skip path should be obvious; the not-skip path should be unchanged. Atomic commit.

---

### Task 12: Clarify `semantic-merge` standalone vs delegated (mode-aware verification)
**Review status:** *(not started)*

**Files affected:** `skills/semantic-merge/SKILL.md`
**Input:** `semantic-merge` §Invocation Pattern (lines 24–31) currently says "process is identical, only the caller differs." Today this means semantic-merge does its own drift-test re-run inside Tier 1/2/3 even when `merge-workflow` will then re-run them in Step 2a.
**Output:** Two explicit modes documented. Standalone owns all post-merge verification (drift tests, pipeline, stale-reference check). Delegated trims duplicates: it does what tier classification requires (e.g., Tier 2/3 propose+review), and leaves drift-test re-run + integration review to the caller.

- [ ] **Step 1: Rewrite §Invocation Pattern** to spell out the difference. Add a "Mode-aware verification" subsection enumerating which post-merge checks each mode runs. (Standalone: tier classification, conflict resolution, drift tests, pipeline, stale-reference check, report. Delegated: tier classification, conflict resolution, return tier + caller-relevant context. The caller — `merge-workflow` — runs drift tests + integration review on the merged state in its Step 2.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Add a parameter to the invocation contract.** When the caller is `merge-workflow`, the Skill invocation is `superRA:semantic-merge` with task: `"merge <base> into <analysis> — delegated mode: skip post-merge drift tests and pipeline run; the caller will verify"`. Document this in `merge-workflow` Step 1 alongside the existing invocation example.

- [ ] **Step 3: Update Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3 sections** to gate the post-merge drift-test step ("If standalone: run drift tests. If delegated: skip — caller will run."). Same for pipeline and stale-reference checks.

- [ ] **Step 4: Validate.** Re-read `semantic-merge` end-to-end in both modes. Re-read `merge-workflow` Step 1. The two skills should now be redundancy-free across the boundary. Atomic commit.

### Task 13: Distribute `verification-before-completion` content + delete the skill
**Review status:** *(not started)*

**Files affected:** `skills/verification-before-completion/` (delete), `agents/implementer.md`, `agents/reviewer.md`, `skills/refactor-and-integrate/references/drift-test-quality.md`, `skills/execution-workflow/SKILL.md`, `skills/using-superRA/SKILL.md` (inventory + types), `skills/CATEGORIES.md`, `README.md`, `skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md` (one mention)
**Input:** `verification-before-completion/SKILL.md` (143 lines). Per the content audit: ~30 lines of unique content; ~110 lines of duplication with `econ-data-analysis` Red Flags + Common Rationalizations, `agents/reviewer.md` "DO NOT take the implementer's word", and `execution-workflow` Step 3 §Completion verification.
**Output:** Unique content distributed to four call sites (implementer self-check, reviewer claim-verification, drift-test creation, execution-workflow Step 3). Skill deleted. ~110 duplicated lines disappear; ~30 lines land where they're actually used.

- [ ] **Step 1: Move the 5-step Gate Function** (IDENTIFY → RUN → READ → VERIFY → claim) into `agents/implementer.md` §Self-Review Before Reporting. Replace the current 4-line Self-Review intro with the gate framework + the Bottom Line one-liner: "Run the command. Read the output. Then claim the result."

- [ ] **Step 2: Move the red-flag *wording* list** ("should", "probably", "seems to", "Great!", "Done!", "Perfect!") into both `agents/implementer.md` §Pre-Commit Self-Check and `agents/reviewer.md` §Pre-Commit Self-Check. Keep it as a 5-line block in each (acceptable duplication — these are local to each role's commit gate, and the content is short and tight).

- [ ] **Step 3: Move the Red-Green TDD pattern for regression / drift tests** ("Write → Run pass → Revert fix → Run MUST FAIL → Restore → Run pass") into `skills/refactor-and-integrate/references/drift-test-quality.md` as a new "Red-Green Verification" section. This is where drift tests are written, so it is the natural home — the rule belongs next to the test-writing checklist.

- [ ] **Step 4: Sharpen `agents/reviewer.md` §Verify Claims Independently.** Today says "DO NOT take the implementer's word." Add: "Check the git diff, not just the status return — agents can report 'success' for partial work. The status return is a navigation aid; the diff is the evidence."

- [ ] **Step 5: Add one sentence to `execution-workflow` Step 3 preamble.** At the top of Step 3 (Verify Pipeline and Reproducibility): "Run every check. Don't trust 'looks committed' — execute `git status` and read the output. The five checks below are the orchestrator's verification gate."

- [ ] **Step 6: Delete the skill.** `git rm -r skills/verification-before-completion/`.

- [ ] **Step 7: Sweep references.**
  ```bash
  grep -rn "verification-before-completion\|superRA:verification-before-completion" skills/ agents/ commands/ README.md CLAUDE.md CATEGORIES.md
  ```
  Remove from `using-superRA` §Skill Inventory and §Skill Types ("Rigid" example list — replace with `econ-data-analysis` only); remove from `CATEGORIES.md` Utility table; remove from `README.md` skill table; in `writing-skills/SKILL.md` line 401 ("**Examples:** TDD, verification-before-completion, designing-before-coding"), drop the verification-before-completion mention.

- [ ] **Step 8: Validate.** Grep again; should appear only in this PLAN.md and CHANGELOG. Re-read `agents/implementer.md` and `agents/reviewer.md` end-to-end — each should now carry the verification discipline natively at the right moment in the role flow. Re-read `drift-test-quality.md` — Red-Green section should sit naturally next to the existing test-quality content. Re-read `execution-workflow` Step 3 — preamble should now lean into the orchestrator's responsibility for evidence. Atomic commit.

### Task 14: Consolidate worktree skills (drop `using-analysis-worktrees`)
**Review status:** *(not started)*

**Files affected:** `skills/using-analysis-worktrees/SKILL.md` (delete), `skills/worktree-data-sync/SKILL.md` (broaden scope), `skills/planning-workflow/SKILL.md` (move "when to use" judgment), `skills/merge-workflow/SKILL.md` (point cleanup at consolidated skill), `skills/execution-workflow/SKILL.md` (Option 4 cleanup), `skills/using-superRA/SKILL.md` (inventory), `skills/CATEGORIES.md`, `README.md`, all references to `using-analysis-worktrees`
**Input:** `using-analysis-worktrees` is mostly judgment ("when to use") + git mechanics (every harness knows). The data-sync content is genuinely valuable; cleanup is duplicated in `merge-workflow` and `execution-workflow`.
**Output:** One worktree skill (`worktree-data-sync`, broadened) covering: (a) when to use a worktree (one-paragraph judgment), (b) data sync (existing content), (c) cleanup ritual. Skill inventory shrinks by one.

- [ ] **Step 1: Broaden `worktree-data-sync` scope.** Add two sections to its SKILL.md:
  - "When to use a worktree" — one paragraph, relocated from `using-analysis-worktrees` (kept tight: judgment, not how-to).
  - "Cleanup" — the canonical `git worktree remove` ritual + the case where the worktree was created by data-sync (cleanup also removes seeded data).
  
  Update the skill description to reflect the broader scope. Run `superRA:writing-skills` triggering checks since description changed.

- [ ] **Step 2: Delete `using-analysis-worktrees`.** `git rm -r skills/using-analysis-worktrees/`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Move "when to use" judgment from `planning-workflow`** (§Before you create directories) to point at `worktree-data-sync` §When to use. Keep the planning-workflow's one-sentence reminder.

- [ ] **Step 4: Replace cleanup duplications.** In `merge-workflow` Step 5 and `execution-workflow` Step 4 Option 4 (Discard), replace the inline `git worktree remove` block with: "Invoke `superRA:worktree-data-sync` §Cleanup."

- [ ] **Step 5: Sweep references.**
  ```bash
  grep -rn "using-analysis-worktrees\|superRA:using-analysis-worktrees" skills/ agents/ commands/ README.md CLAUDE.md
  ```
  Update every match to point at `worktree-data-sync` (often the surrounding context determines which sub-section).

- [ ] **Step 6: Update inventory tables.** Remove `using-analysis-worktrees` row from `using-superRA` §Skill Inventory, `CATEGORIES.md`, `README.md`.

- [ ] **Step 7: Validate.** Grep again. Re-read `worktree-data-sync` end-to-end — it should now be self-contained. Atomic commit.

### Task 15: Remove deprecated commands
**Review status:** *(not started)*

**Files affected:** `commands/execute-plan.md`, `commands/write-plan.md`, `commands/brainstorm.md`, `using-superRA` (skill inventory references), `README.md`
**Input:** Three stub commands point at `superpowers:*` skills that are not part of this plugin. If the user doesn't have `obra/superpowers` installed, the commands silently fail.
**Output:** The three deprecated command stubs are removed. No silent failures.

- [ ] **Step 1: Delete the stubs.**
  ```bash
  git rm commands/execute-plan.md commands/write-plan.md commands/brainstorm.md
  ```

- [ ] **Step 2: Sweep references.**
  ```bash
  grep -rn "execute-plan\|write-plan\|brainstorm" skills/ commands/ README.md CLAUDE.md
  ```
  Remove the "Deprecated — use superpowers:* instead" rows from any inventory tables (likely in README.md or CHANGELOG).

- [ ] **Step 3: Validate.** Atomic commit.

---

### Task 16: Final consistency pass
**Review status:** *(not started)*

**Files affected:** `skills/CATEGORIES.md`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `RELEASE-NOTES.md`, every skill touched in Tasks 1–15
**Input:** Cumulative diff of Tasks 1–15.
**Output:** All inventory tables match the post-refactor skill set. CHANGELOG/RELEASE-NOTES have an entry. The "four principles" claim is consistent across files. End-to-end re-read confirms no drift.

- [ ] **Step 1: Sync inventory tables.** Update `skills/CATEGORIES.md` (Workflow / Domain / Utility / Meta tables), `README.md` skill tables, and `using-superRA` §Skill Inventory to reflect:
  - Removed: `script-to-notebook`, `using-analysis-worktrees`
  - Broadened: `worktree-data-sync`
  - Added rows for `references/main-agent-autonomy.md` and `references/review-checklist.md` if those tables enumerate references.

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify "four principles" consistency.**
  ```bash
  grep -rn "four \(load-bearing\|workflow\|discipline\) principles\|six \(discipline\) principles" skills/ agents/ CLAUDE.md README.md
  ```
  Confirm "four" everywhere (no stray "six"). The installed plugin description (visible at session start) may show "six" — that's a deployment-cache issue, not a repo issue, and resolves on next install.

- [ ] **Step 3: End-to-end re-read.** Walk every workflow skill (`planning-workflow`, `execution-workflow`, `integration-workflow`, `merge-workflow`, `semantic-merge`, `agent-orchestration`) plus `using-superRA`, `handoff-doc`, `econ-data-analysis`, `refactor-and-integrate`, `report-in-markdown`, `verification-before-completion`, `worktree-data-sync`, both agent files. Catch any orphan reference, broken pointer, contradictory line, or stale Stage name introduced by interactions between Tasks 1–15.

- [ ] **Step 4: Update CHANGELOG and RELEASE-NOTES** with a single entry summarizing the refactor: stage consolidation, two skills folded, project-doc-audit relocated, verification-before-completion connected, worktree skills consolidated. Cite this PLAN.md by branch/SHA so the design rationale is auditable.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run `superRA:writing-skills` triggering checks** for every skill whose description was modified across the refactor (at minimum: `worktree-data-sync` after Task 14, `econ-data-analysis` if its description was touched in Task 3, and `using-superRA` if Task 1 / Task 6 modified its description). Confirm each still triggers on its intended cues and doesn't trigger on cues meant for sibling skills.

- [ ] **Step 6: Validate.** Final grep sweep for the strings: `script-to-notebook`, `using-analysis-worktrees`, `execute-plan`, `write-plan`, `brainstorm`, `Stage: implementation review`, `Stage: drift test creation`, `Stage: integration review`, `Stage: merge proposer`, `sub-part B`, `recipe`. None should appear in skill bodies (only in PLAN.md / CHANGELOG history, which is fine). Atomic commit.

## Out of scope (deferred)

These items came up in the design review but were explicitly deferred:

- **D6 (failure-recovery sections in workflow skills)** — deferred. Will be revisited if real failure modes accumulate.
- **D7 (analysis-testing skill for non-drift tests)** — deferred. Open question whether to add a new skill or fold into `econ-data-analysis`.
- **README user-facing content (B6)** — left as-is; intentionally duplicates principles for the user-facing entry point.
- **The `six principles` discrepancy in the installed plugin (A4)** — repo is correct ("four"); will resolve on next plugin install/release.
