# Flexible Integration-Workflow + General Semantic-Merge Refactor (Round 2)

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED DISCIPLINE: Use `superRA:handoff-doc` for all PLAN.md / RESULTS.md editing. This refactor edits skill files — every implementer and reviewer dispatch MUST additionally load `document-skills:skill-creator` and apply its conciseness, progressive-disclosure, and one-source-of-truth discipline. Preserve carefully-tuned content (Red Flags tables, rationalization lists, RA-framing language) per `/CLAUDE.md §Skill Changes`. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax.

**Objective:** (a) Make `integration-workflow` Phase B a flexible, review-led loop by dropping the Tier 1/2/3 matrix, the shortcut-axis evaluation, the named recon/verify split, and the two-commit implementer contract — replaced by an Integration Intent mechanism in PLAN.md that lets the reviewer drive the fix-review cycle through per-task annotations. (b) Generalize `semantic-merge/SKILL.md` on top of the global `semantic-merge-integration` skill so it reads coherently for any vertical (analysis, writing, modeling) and any caller (agent, orchestrator, human at terminal) — dropping the Standalone/Delegated mode split, the named return-field contract, and in-skill dispatch blocks; stating a 1+N commit shape as *one* possible workflow.

**Methodology:** Skill-design refactor. No code, no data, no pipeline. Everything lives in superRA skill files and cross-cutting docs (`plan-anatomy.md`, `agents/`, `agent-orchestration`, `README.md`, `CATEGORIES.md`, `RELEASE-NOTES.md`, `using-superRA` Skill-Load Manifest). The round-1 `refactor-and-integrate` checklist and the canonical dispatch shape are preserved unchanged.

**DRY audit baseline.** Do not restate content that is already carried by a skill in the integration stage's load set. The following are linked, never restated: APPROVE/REVISE adjudication (`agent-orchestration §Handling Reviewer Feedback`), dispatch shape (`agent-orchestration §Dispatch Templates`), reviewer-owns-verdict-flip + annotation etiquette (`agents/reviewer.md`, `agents/implementer.md`, `plan-anatomy.md`), User Decisions Log (`handoff-doc`), re-entry / Changing Plans (`planning-workflow §Changing Plans`), minimum-net-diff / scope-by-integration-status / drift-test integrity (`refactor-and-integrate` + references), stop-point discipline (`using-superRA §Universal Principles`). **Exception:** `execution-workflow` is NOT in the integration stage's load set; the per-task fix-review inner loop is therefore restated tightly in `integration-workflow` Phase B Step 3 (with the integration-specific twist — REVISE-status scope, APPROVED-integration refusal, mechanical merge first) rather than linked.

**Output:** Modified `skills/integration-workflow/SKILL.md`, `skills/semantic-merge/SKILL.md`, `skills/handoff-doc/references/plan-anatomy.md`, `skills/agent-orchestration/SKILL.md`, `agents/reviewer.md`, `agents/implementer.md`; peripheral surfaces synced (`README.md`, `skills/CATEGORIES.md`, `RELEASE-NOTES.md`, `skills/using-superRA/SKILL.md`). No code or data outputs.

**Expected Results:** (a) `integration-workflow` Phase B is ~half its current length; Tier/shortcut/two-commit/recon-verify vocabulary is fully removed. (b) `semantic-merge/SKILL.md` reads coherently for a human running `git merge` on a non-analysis branch with no hidden orchestrator assumptions. (c) Integration Intent is a first-class PLAN.md section with documented lifecycle. (d) Parallel reviewers are a supported orchestration pattern (extension in `agent-orchestration`, not duplicated in workflow skills).

**Pipeline:** N/A (skill refactor; single entry point is the git history of this branch).

## Project Conventions

Walked at planning time (2026-04-19). Re-walk on-demand only. Round 1 walked the same surfaces 2026-04-19; summaries below are carried forward because the repo state is unchanged except for the round-1 refactor itself (which round 2 partially revises).

### Repo root
- `/CLAUDE.md` (HEAD at f346161): Contributor guide for superRA. Four workflow principles (implementer-reviewer pair, handoff docs as auditable record, fast-early-strict-before-merge with semantic-merges, autonomous with human-in-loop). Architectural pattern: lean agents, rich references, flat skills/ layout. DRY with one source of truth per concern. Skill edits require reading before changing, one problem per commit, testing on at least one harness.
- `/README.md`: superRA skill inventory by Workflow / Domain / Utility / Meta categories. Needs peripheral update in Task 5.

### Module-level docs walked
- `skills/CATEGORIES.md`: Workflow / Domain / Utility / Meta grouping table; stays in sync with README.
- `skills/using-superRA/SKILL.md` §Skill-Load Manifest: authoritative `Stage:` → loads map. `integration` and `merge` rows to be revisited in Task 5.
- `skills/agent-orchestration/SKILL.md` §Dispatch Templates + §Handling Reviewer Feedback + §Concurrent Writers Require Worktree Isolation: canonical dispatch shape and parallel-dispatch pattern; §Concurrent Writers currently frames around implementers (Worktree field is implementer-only per SKILL.md:143) — Task 4 extends with a parallel-reviewer note.
- `skills/handoff-doc/references/plan-anatomy.md`: PLAN.md anatomy. Integration-status lifecycle paragraph (line 179, round-1 Task 8) is symmetric with Review-status and stays. Task 2 adds a new `## Integration Intent` subsection.
- `skills/refactor-and-integrate/SKILL.md` + references: minimum-net-diff, scope-by-integration-status, drift-test integrity. **Preserved unchanged.**
- `skills/planning-workflow/SKILL.md` §Changing Plans: re-entry protocol covering B→B, C→B, D→B, mid-workflow scope change. **Preserved unchanged** — the round-1 B→B trigger sentence in `plan-anatomy.md:179` stays.
- `skills/integration-workflow/SKILL.md`: target of the main rewrite. Currently ~450 lines; carries Tier matrix (Phase B Step 2), shortcut-axis evaluation, two-commit implementer contract (Step 3), and recon/verify naming split — all removed by Task 1.
- `skills/semantic-merge/SKILL.md`: target of Task 3. Currently carries Standalone/Delegated mode split, named return-field contract, in-skill dispatch blocks, analysis-only vocabulary — all removed.
- `~/.claude/skills/semantic-merge-integration/SKILL.md` (global): domain-neutral baseline for Task 3's rewrite. Read-only reference.

### Not walked (not reachable from the planned diff)
- `/hooks/` — no hook changes expected.
- `skills/econ-data-analysis/**` — domain vertical unaffected.
- `skills/report-in-markdown/**`, `skills/worktree-data-sync/**`, `skills/zotero-paper-reader/**`, `skills/execution-workflow/**` — unaffected; execution-workflow's inner loop is restated (not linked) in Task 1 output because it is not in the integration stage's load set.

---

### Task 1: Rewrite `integration-workflow` Phase B
**Depends on:** *(none)*
**Review status:** IMPLEMENTED
**Integration status:** APPROVED

**Script:** N/A
**Input:** current `skills/integration-workflow/SKILL.md`, `skills/handoff-doc/references/plan-anatomy.md` (Integration Intent anatomy produced by Task 2 — cross-referenced only after Task 2 lands; Task 1 names the section and describes purpose/ownership inline), `skills/agent-orchestration/SKILL.md` §Dispatch Templates + §Handling Reviewer Feedback + §Concurrent Writers (parallel-reviewer extension produced by Task 4 — cross-referenced only after Task 4 lands), `skills/refactor-and-integrate/SKILL.md` + references (linked, unchanged)
**Output:** Rewritten Phase B section in `skills/integration-workflow/SKILL.md` — review-led loop with four steps; Tier matrix and shortcut-axis evaluation removed; two-commit implementer contract replaced with a brief "1+N: mechanical merge first, refactors after" note that points at `semantic-merge` for the shape; recon/verify naming split collapsed to "integration reviewer"; Red Flags + Always lists updated; metadata block (Called by / Invokes / Escalates to / Pairs with / Requires) updated.

- [x] **Step 1: Describe — read the current Phase B end-to-end**

  Read `skills/integration-workflow/SKILL.md` lines 85–199 (Phase B proper) plus the Red Flags list (lines ~394–424) and the Integration block (lines ~428–452). Identified all removal targets: Tier 1/2/3 matrix, two-axis shortcut evaluation, recon reviewer, verify reviewer, two-commit structure, delegated mode.

- [x] **Step 2: Draft the four-step Phase B skeleton**

  Written Phase B as four steps: (1) Dispatch integration reviewer — walks branch diff and main-side diff, writes Integration Intent if material changes found, annotates per-task blockquotes, flips REVISE; (2) Orchestrator adjudicate — zero annotations fast-path or batch AskUserQuestion; (3) Fix-review loop — 3a mechanical merge first (semantic-merge when conflicts/material changes), 3b refactor commits scoped to REVISE tasks with dispatch template, 3c re-dispatch reviewer until APPROVE; (4) Flip Refactored milestone when all tasks APPROVED and Intent section empty.

- [x] **Step 3: Update the Phase Map diagram and re-entry arrows**

  Phase Map updated — removed "Recon-Driven, Two Shortcut Axes" sub-heading and "Internal Structure" section. Re-entry arrows (B→B, C→B, D→B) preserved. D→B comment updated to reference Phase D pre-merge check.

- [x] **Step 4: Update Red Flags + Always + metadata blocks**

  Red Flags: removed Tier, recon reviewer, verify reviewer, two-commit structure, shortcut axes, delegated mode bullets. Always list: removed Tier/shortcut/recon-verify wording; updated semantic-merge bullet to describe intent-based resolution trigger (reviewer decides, not Tier gate). Metadata §Invokes updated to drop "REQUIRED on Tier 2/3" qualifier.

- [x] **Step 5: Validate — walk the four workflow principles**

  All four workflow principles preserved. `grep -n "Tier 1\|Tier 2\|Tier 3\|recon reviewer\|verify reviewer\|two-commit\|shortcut ax" skills/integration-workflow/SKILL.md` → empty. Committed.

---

### Task 2: Add `## Integration Intent` anatomy to `plan-anatomy.md`
**Depends on:** *(none)*
**Review status:** IMPLEMENTED
**Integration status:** APPROVED

**Script:** N/A
**Input:** `skills/handoff-doc/references/plan-anatomy.md`, existing `## Decisions` anatomy entry as a structural template.
**Output:** New `## Integration Intent` subsection in `plan-anatomy.md`, placed between the existing `## User Decisions Log` and `## Task Block Anatomy` sections. Documents purpose, ownership (reviewer-only; implementer hands-off), lifecycle (written by reviewer when Phase B scan finds material main-side change → per-item removal on dependent-task APPROVE → section removal when empty), format (one bullet per incoming-change cluster, each bullet names affected task IDs + one-sentence why-it-matters), and placement (directly after `## Decisions` if present, before the first task block).

- [x] **Step 1: Describe — pattern-match against `## Decisions`**

  Read `plan-anatomy.md:99–120` (`## User Decisions Log`) and the existing `## Decisions` placement rule at line 67. The Integration Intent section follows the same placement logic: header context → `## Workflow Status` → `## Decisions` (optional) → `## Integration Intent` (optional) → `---` → task blocks. Confirmed: `## Decisions` placement note updated to include `## Integration Intent` in the order.

- [x] **Step 2: Draft the anatomy entry**

  Added new `## Integration Intent` section between `## User Decisions Log` and `## Task Block Anatomy` in `plan-anatomy.md`. Covers: (a) purpose paragraph bridging Phase B main-side scan to per-task fix-review loop; (b) ownership (integration reviewer only; implementer hands-off; orchestrator `→ orchestrator:` annotations only); (c) lifecycle (write on Phase B Step 1 scan finding material changes → remove items as dependent tasks hit `APPROVED` → remove section when empty); (d) format code block with two-line blockquote cluster (`Main-side change` + `Adaptation needed`) naming affected task IDs explicitly.

- [x] **Step 3: Validate — coherence check against B→B trigger**

  B→B trigger sentence at `plan-anatomy.md §Field-by-Field Notes` confirmed consistent: integration reviewer's annotation gates the flip. Rewrote the `**Integration status:**` paragraph to replace "recon reviewer", "unified implementer", "verify reviewer" with "integration reviewer (annotation pass)", "implementer", "integration reviewer (verify pass)" — reviewer-owns-verdict-flip semantics and B→B trigger sentence preserved. Also updated `Refactored` checkbox in the Workflow Status template from "verify reviewer" to "integration reviewer".

### Task 3: Rewrite `semantic-merge/SKILL.md` as general-purpose skill
**Depends on:** *(none)*
**Review status:** IMPLEMENTED
**Integration status:** APPROVED

**Script:** N/A
**Input:** current `skills/semantic-merge/SKILL.md`, global `~/.claude/skills/semantic-merge-integration/SKILL.md` as tone/structure baseline.
**Output:** Rewritten `skills/semantic-merge/SKILL.md` that reads as a skill for thoughtful merging — usable by a human at the terminal, by the orchestrator running it directly, or by a dispatched agent, with the same text. Domain-neutral vocabulary. 1+N commit shape stated as *one possible workflow*, not mandated.

- [x] **Step 1: Describe — read the global baseline + current superRA version**

  Read `~/.claude/skills/semantic-merge-integration/SKILL.md` end-to-end. Read `skills/semantic-merge/SKILL.md` end-to-end. Identified: (a) global skill content to reuse: intent-first framing, diffs for inferring intent, regeneration over hand-edit for derived artifacts, ask-user-when-ambiguous discipline; (b) superRA-specific content to retain: drift-test integrity as safety net, RA framing, handoff-doc coherence with PLAN.md/RESULTS.md conflict escalation to `planning-workflow §Changing Plans`; (c) removal targets: Standalone/Delegated mode split, named return-field contract, in-skill dispatch blocks, Tier 1/2/3 matrix, domain-specific vocabulary (`excess_return`, `variable_construction.py`, `Table 3`, econometric specs, sample filters).

- [x] **Step 2: Draft the rewritten skill**

  Written with structure: frontmatter → Overview → Core principle → The process (6 steps: ground → understand intent → integration map → ask user → resolve/integrate → verify) → Working principles → When to ask the user → What to report → Red Flags → Integration. 1+N commit shape stated explicitly as one possible workflow. Domain-neutral vocabulary throughout; one illustrative example in Step 4 (outcome variable construction) without analysis-specific names.

- [x] **Step 3: Remove dispatch-focused content**

  Deleted: Invocation Pattern section (two-mode split), Mode-aware verification table, in-skill `Agent(subagent_type: ...)` dispatch blocks for Tier 2/3, "What to Report — delegated mode" return-field contract, Tier 1/2/3 classification matrix. Integration block updated to "Called by `integration-workflow` Phase B Step 3 mechanical-merge commit, when conflicts or material main-side changes exist; Phase D re-sync when main has advanced; or standalone by any agent or human."

- [x] **Step 4: Validate — terminal-use dry-read**

  Dry-read passed as a human running `git merge main` on a paper-drafting branch: no dispatching-caller assumptions, no data-analysis vocabulary except the illustrative example (which uses neutral phrasing). Grep for `Standalone\|Delegated\|excess_return\|Table 3\|econometric\|variable_construction\|delegated mode` → empty. Grep for `Tier 1\|Tier 2\|Tier 3\|recon reviewer\|verify reviewer\|two-commit\|Agent(subagent` → empty.

---

### Task 4: Extend `agent-orchestration §Concurrent Writers` with parallel-reviewer note
**Depends on:** *(none)*
**Review status:** IMPLEMENTED
**Integration status:** APPROVED

**Script:** N/A
**Input:** `skills/agent-orchestration/SKILL.md` §Concurrent Writers Require Worktree Isolation (existing section, implementer-framed).
**Output:** One additional short paragraph in `agent-orchestration §Concurrent Writers` generalizing the pattern to parallel reviewers walking disjoint slices of a large diff — same worktree isolation, same split-by-disjoint-scope, same orchestrator-aggregates-verdicts pattern. One-sentence note that the `Worktree:` dispatch field applies to reviewers in this configuration too.

> **Review notes (integration):**
> 1. [MINOR] `skills/agent-orchestration/SKILL.md` line 125 area — the Reviewer Dispatch Template block shows no `Worktree:` optional field line, while the Implementer block (line 115) shows `Worktree: <absolute path>   # optional — parallel-dispatch only`. The `Worktree:` field spec paragraph (line 145) covers both roles in prose, so an orchestrator who reads the full spec will find it. But a reader building a reviewer dispatch from the template block alone won't see the field as an option. Pre-existing gap, not introduced by this commit; low priority since the spec paragraph is just a few lines below. Task 5 or a targeted follow-on could add `Worktree: <absolute path>   # optional — parallel-reviewer pattern only` to the Reviewer template block for symmetry.

- [x] **Step 1: Describe — read the current §Concurrent Writers**

  Read `skills/agent-orchestration/SKILL.md` §Concurrent Writers Require Worktree Isolation plus the `Worktree:` field spec (SKILL.md:143). Identified core pattern (isolated worktree per concurrent writer) and the implementer-specific framing ("Applies to implementers only") that needed generalizing.

- [x] **Step 2: Draft the extension**

  Added one paragraph to §Concurrent Writers (after the implementer-default sentence): parallel reviewers on disjoint worktrees when diff exceeds ~150k threshold; orchestrator splits by task ID / file subtree / commit range; aggregates per-slice verdicts; `Worktree:` field applies to reviewers in this configuration. Updated the `Worktree:` field spec note at SKILL.md:143 to read "parallel-dispatch only; implementers always, reviewers when using the parallel-reviewer pattern in §Concurrent Writers".

- [x] **Step 3: Validate — cross-read with Task 1**

  Grepped: `grep -n "parallel reviewer\|reviewer.*worktree"` returns hits at lines 79 and 145. Task 1's Phase B Step 1 + Step 3 references to "parallel siblings on worktrees" work against this extension.

---

### Task 5: Sync peripheral surfaces
**Depends on:** Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4
**Review status:** IMPLEMENTED
**Integration status:** *(set during integration)*

**Script:** N/A
**Input:** `README.md`, `skills/CATEGORIES.md`, `RELEASE-NOTES.md`, `skills/using-superRA/SKILL.md` §Skill-Load Manifest, `agents/reviewer.md`, `agents/implementer.md`.
**Output:** Peripheral docs updated to match Round 2's language: no residual "recon/verify reviewer", "Tier 1/2/3", "delegated mode", "Standalone mode" anywhere in the active skills graph; Skill-Load Manifest `integration` / `merge` rows simplified; `agents/reviewer.md` §What You Own + §Editing Etiquette extended to cover Integration Intent ownership; `agents/implementer.md` §What You Own extended with hands-off note for Integration Intent; RELEASE-NOTES.md has a new "Unreleased" entry. Also folded in MINOR advisories R1–R4.

- [x] **Step 1: Update agent files**

  `agents/reviewer.md` §What You Own: replaced stale "recon reviewer / verify reviewer" integration-status flip language with "integration reviewer (annotation pass) / integration reviewer (verify pass)"; added `## Integration Intent` ownership bullet — writes at Phase B Step 1, per-item removes when last named dependent task reaches APPROVED, section-removes when empty; no other role edits it. §Editing Etiquette: added sentence that inline-edit + boundary-preservation rules apply to Integration Intent edits too. Pre-commit self-check: updated to name `## Integration Intent` writes/removes as integration-reviewer-owned.

  `agents/implementer.md` §What You Own: reworded integration-status line to drop "two-commit" and "recon/verify reviewer" vocabulary; added explicit hands-off paragraph for `## Integration Intent`.

- [x] **Step 2: Update Skill-Load Manifest**

  `skills/using-superRA/SKILL.md`: replaced stale paragraph below the manifest table ("delegated mode" / "Tier 2/3" language) with neutral wording describing when `merge` stage is used and how Phase B loads `semantic-merge`.

- [x] **Step 3: Update README, CATEGORIES, RELEASE-NOTES**

  `README.md`: Mermaid INT2 node updated (removed "recon reviewer + unified implementer + verify reviewer" / "Tier 2/3" language); integration-workflow row updated in skill table; semantic-merge row made vertical-neutral; "How It Works" paragraph updated; "invokes semantic-merge internally on Tier 2/3" fixed.
  `skills/CATEGORIES.md`: integration-workflow row simplified; semantic-merge row made vertical-neutral.
  `RELEASE-NOTES.md`: added new `## Unreleased — flexible integration-workflow + general semantic-merge refactor` heading with four bullets.

- [x] **Step 4: Validate — sweep**

  `grep -rn "recon reviewer|verify reviewer|delegated mode|Standalone mode" skills/ agents/ README.md` → empty (active content only; RELEASE-NOTES historical entries excluded). Remaining `two-commit` hits are in `refactor-and-integrate/SKILL.md` merge-quality section (legitimate 1+N merge commit vocabulary, not the removed integration-workflow two-commit contract). R1–R4 advisory fixes applied; see RESULTS.md Task 5 for per-item notes.

---

### Task 6: End-to-end dry-read verification
**Depends on:** Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
**Review status:** *(set during execution)*
**Integration status:** *(set during integration)*

**Script:** N/A
**Input:** All round-2 refactored skills + agent files + peripheral docs.
**Output:** Walk-through notes in `RESULTS.md` covering seven scenarios; confirms the refactor is internally coherent and the round-1 invariants still hold; any [ADVISORY] stale-vocabulary hits fixed in-place (no tuned content touched); any [BLOCKING] issue opened as a review-notes entry on the relevant prior task for re-entry.

- [ ] **Step 1: Scenario (a) — no-main-movement fast path**

  Hypothetical branch: APPROVED PLAN.md, code-complete, `origin/main` has not advanced since merge-base. Walk Phase A (drift tests authored, all pass) → Phase B Step 1 (integration reviewer walks both diffs; main-side scan finds nothing; no Integration Intent section written; no per-task annotations; Integration status stays APPROVED across all tasks) → Step 2 (orchestrator reads PLAN.md, no adjudication needed) → Step 3 (skipped — no REVISE tasks; mechanical merge is a no-op fast-forward since merge-base is main tip) → Step 4 (Refactored milestone flips) → Phase C → Phase D. Confirm the flow terminates cleanly.

- [ ] **Step 2: Scenario (b) — Integration Intent path**

  Hypothetical branch: main has advanced with a cross-cutting refactor of a shared utility; incoming change touches the utility plus a README section that two of this branch's tasks also edit. Walk Phase B Step 1 (reviewer writes Integration Intent section with two bullets + per-task annotations; flips two tasks to REVISE); Step 2 (orchestrator batches a single user-decision on adaptation approach); Step 3 (mechanical merge commit first via `semantic-merge`; then refactor commits scoped to the two REVISE tasks; reviewer re-review APPROVES both, removes review-notes, removes the corresponding Integration Intent bullets, and when both bullets are gone, removes the section). Confirm the ownership contract (reviewer-only for Intent writes + removes) holds.

- [ ] **Step 3: Scenario (c) — parallel reviewers on a large diff**

  Hypothetical branch: 20+ tasks; Phase B Step 1 needs to walk a cumulative diff that would exceed one reviewer's context. Walk the orchestrator split: three reviewers dispatched on disjoint worktrees, each walking a ~7-task slice; their verdicts aggregated; per-task annotations land in PLAN.md as if from one reviewer. Confirm the Task 4 extension paragraph covers the mechanics; confirm disjoint-scope invariant holds.

- [ ] **Step 4: Scenario (d) — 1+N with parallel refactor implementers**

  Hypothetical continuation of Scenario (b) but with five tasks flipped to REVISE and adaptation work that is independent across them. Walk Step 3's mechanical-merge commit (one implementer, serial, branch-wide) then the N refactor commits dispatched as five parallel sibling implementers on worktrees. Confirm the 1+N shape reads as "one possible workflow" in both `integration-workflow` Phase B and `semantic-merge`, not mandated.

- [ ] **Step 5: Scenario (e) — B→B re-entry**

  Hypothetical: Phase B had approved; while Phase C was mid-flight, main advanced again. Walk the C→B re-entry via `planning-workflow §Changing Plans`: `Refactored` unchecks, re-enter Phase B Step 1; reviewer re-walks; new Integration Intent bullet written if material; fix-review loop re-runs. Confirm the existing `plan-anatomy.md:179` B→B trigger sentence (round-1 Task 5) still reads correctly against Task 2's rewritten `**Integration status:**` paragraph.

- [ ] **Step 6: Scenarios (f) + (g) — plan-change escalation and standalone semantic-merge**

  (f): Phase B Step 1 reviewer surfaces a finding that is a substantive restructure (a task needs to be removed because main deleted the feature it analyzed). Walk the escalation to `planning-workflow §Changing Plans` — orchestrator authors the proposal, researcher decides, PLAN.md updated inline, re-entry.

  (g): A human runs `git merge` at the terminal on a paper-drafting branch that has no PLAN.md and no drift tests. Walk the rewritten `semantic-merge/SKILL.md` from top to bottom. Confirm nothing in the skill forces the existence of a PLAN.md, drift tests, or a dispatching caller; confirm the handoff-doc coherence and drift-test integrity clauses degrade gracefully to no-ops when those artifacts are absent.

- [ ] **Step 7: Write findings to `RESULTS.md`; fix ADVISORY issues in place; commit**

  For each scenario, write a short paragraph in RESULTS.md noting pass/fail and any residual stale vocabulary or coherence gaps. Fix [ADVISORY] items in place (naming-only, prose-only). Open [BLOCKING] items as review-notes entries on the relevant prior task for re-entry. Commit.
