# Codex Agent Dispatch Preference Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED DISCIPLINE: Use `superRA:handoff-doc` for all `PLAN.md` / `RESULTS.md` editing. Use `skill-creator` when modifying any `skills/*/SKILL.md`. Keep shared workflow text canonical; put Codex-specific runtime guidance in the Codex adapter reference unless a cross-reference becomes misleading.

**Objective:** Make Codex treat a user-invoked superRA workflow as explicit authorization for the named-agent workflow, with reviewer dispatch still mandatory unless the user explicitly opts out or agent tools are unavailable.

**Methodology:** Update the one file that owns Codex-specific harness behavior, keep the shared workflow text authoritative, and validate the wording with an independent reviewer pass.

**Conventions:** Prefer one source of truth, minimal wording, and harness-specific placement. Do not fork shared workflow behavior into Codex-only copies.

**Output:** Updated Codex harness instructions in `skills/using-superRA/references/codex-tools.md`, plus any narrowly necessary consistency edits if an adjacent document becomes misleading after the change.

**Expected Results / Hypotheses:** A Codex agent that has loaded superRA and is following its workflow should read the adapter as explicit user preference for named-agent dispatch in Codex, rather than treating the harness-default anti-delegation guidance as dominant. Reviewer dispatch should remain non-optional by default.

**Sensitivity Analysis:** *(not applicable — instruction-only change)*

**Pipeline:** *(not needed — single-surface instruction update with review)*

## Workflow Status

- [x] **Plan approved** — researcher signed off on data inventory + plan (`planning-workflow` Phase 2)
- [x] **Execution complete** — all tasks `APPROVED`, pipeline reproducible (`implementation-workflow` Step 3)
- [ ] **Drift tests created** — drift tests passing on baseline (`integration-workflow` Phase A)
- [ ] **Refactored** — integration reviewer `APPROVED` on the unified sync+refactor diff (`integration-workflow` Phase B)
- [ ] **Docs finalized** — RESULTS.md matured, project docs audited, doc-reviewer `APPROVED` (`integration-workflow` Phase C)
- [ ] **Merged** — branch merged to main or PR opened (`integration-workflow` Phase D)

## Project Conventions

Walked at planning time (2026-04-22). Re-walk on-demand only.

### Repo root
- `/CLAUDE.md` (HEAD at `addc9ca`): contributor guidance for superRA itself. Behavior-shaping edits require reading before changing, treating skill changes as skill creation, preserving the four workflow principles, and keeping harness differences in adapter references instead of forking shared workflow text.
- `/AGENTS.md`: symlink to `/CLAUDE.md`; same contributor guidance exposed under the Codex-facing filename.
- `/AGENT.md`: symlink to `/CLAUDE.md`; convenience alias only.
- `/README.md` (HEAD at `addc9ca`): user-facing product overview. superRA promises an implementer-reviewer pair at every step, keeps Codex support split between plugin skills and named custom agents, and describes worktrees as optional workflow infrastructure.

### Module-level docs walked
- *(none beyond repo root; no nested guidance docs lie on the planned diff path)*

### Not walked (not reachable from the planned diff)
- `docs/`, `tests/`, and skill directories outside the orchestration/Codex instruction surfaces — out of scope unless the authoritative change forces a consistency edit.

## Decisions

> **User decision (2026-04-22):** Skip Phase A drift-test creation and proceed directly to Phase B integration review for this branch.
> **Question asked:** Which key results should be protected with drift tests before integration?

### Task 1: Update the Codex harness adapter so superRA invocation authorizes named-agent dispatch
**Depends on:** *(none)*
**Review status:** APPROVED
**Integration status:** *(set during integration)*

**Script:** `skills/using-superRA/references/codex-tools.md` (primary); `skills/using-superRA/references/main-agent.md`, `skills/agent-orchestration/SKILL.md`, and `README.md` only if the adapter change makes an existing statement misleading
**Input:** repo-root contributor docs, current Codex harness adapter wording, current execution-mode/orchestration wording
**Output:** minimal committed instruction update that (a) treats user-invoked superRA workflow/skills as explicit delegation preference in Codex, (b) keeps reviewer dispatch mandatory unless the user explicitly says no or agent tools are unavailable, and (c) preserves the shared workflow files as the source of truth

- [x] Confirmed the ownership boundary between shared workflow text and Codex-specific harness adapters.
- [x] Added the Codex-specific delegation rule in the owning file with the minimum wording needed.
- [x] Checked adjacent docs for stale or contradictory claims; no consistency edits were needed.
