# Semantic Sync Integration Redesign - Results

> Mirrors PLAN.md structure. Updated after each step with key findings.
> New agents: read PLAN.md for what to do, RESULTS.md for what was found.

**Last updated:** 2026-04-23 (Task 6 implemented — semantic-merge restructured for owner-located formats + symmetric procedural richness)
**Status:** Tasks 1-5 APPROVED; Task 6 IMPLEMENTED, awaiting review

---

## Task 1: Refactor semantic-merge around shared principles and mode references

**Status:** Implemented; awaiting review

`skills/semantic-merge/SKILL.md` now carries only shared semantic-sync principles and mode selection. New references split workflow sync authoring, workflow sync review, standalone full merge, Sync Map / impact formats, and shared sync-quality checks.

## Task 2: Rewrite integration-workflow Sync choreography for generic agents

**Status:** Implemented; awaiting review

`skills/integration-workflow/SKILL.md` keeps base/ref anchoring in the workflow, dispatches a generic sync author, dispatches a generic sync reviewer before Integrate, and starts Integrate only after sync review approval.

## Task 3: Define Sync Map, task-local Sync impact, and standalone file-impact anatomy

**Status:** Implemented; awaiting review

`skills/semantic-merge/references/sync-map-format.md` owns the authoritative format templates for the branch-level `## Sync Map` and the task-local `**Sync impact:**` field. `skills/handoff-doc/references/plan-anatomy.md` describes the section's purpose, ownership (including the sync-reviewer minimal-map exception), lifecycle, and placement, and points at the format reference rather than duplicating the templates. Standalone mode uses `SEMANTIC_MERGE.md` with a file / script impact map when no PLAN.md task structure exists.

## Task 4: Simplify canonical role docs and post-sync integration consumption

**Status:** Implemented; awaiting review

Canonical implementer/reviewer docs no longer carry `Stage: sync` branch-level exceptions. `using-superRA` removes Sync from the task-scoped Skill-Load Manifest and records Sync as a generic semantic-merge dispatch. `refactor-and-integrate` now consumes task-local Sync impact and referenced Sync Map clusters without reloading full semantic-merge. Generated Codex agents and direct-mode role references were refreshed.

## Task 5: Update public docs and verify the revised design

**Status:** Implemented; awaiting review

README, CATEGORIES, CLAUDE.md, Codex adapter instructions, and generator tests now describe generic Sync dispatch, standalone semantic-merge mode behavior, sync review, and task-local Sync impact propagation.

Verification passed on 2026-04-23:

```bash
python3 skills/codex-superra-setup/scripts/sync_codex_agents.py --scope project --check
python3 skills/codex-superra-setup/scripts/test_sync_codex_agents.py
git diff --check
rg -n "Stage: sync|At sync stage|branch-level sync review|sync implementer|sync reviewer agent uses|Upstream Intent|merge-quality|NEEDS_USER_DECISION" skills agents README.md CLAUDE.md .codex tests -g '*.md' -g '*.toml' -g '*.py'
```

The targeted terminology scan returned only the expected negative assertions in `skills/codex-superra-setup/scripts/test_sync_codex_agents.py`.

## Task 6: Restructure semantic-merge skill for owner-located formats and symmetric procedural richness

**Status:** Implemented; awaiting review

Restructured the semantic-merge skill so format specs live with their owning mode and shared procedural richness lives in the SKILL.md body. Changes file-by-file:

- `skills/semantic-merge/SKILL.md` — expanded from a lean 42-line body to a 103-line body. Retained Core principle, Choose a Mode, Workflow Boundary, Standalone Boundary, and Exception. Replaced "Shared Rules" with a six-step "Shared Procedure" section covering repo-state grounding (branch / worktree / mid-operation / merge base / incoming range / touched files), dirty-state handling via reversible named stash, intent research with role classification (behavior/API, data/schema, docs/narrative, generated outputs, tests, config/build), resolution-plan construction with synthesis and regeneration preferences, research-meaningful escalation (with `handoff-doc §User Decisions Log` pointer), resolve-and-land with commit-shape deferred to mode refs, and a stale-reference sweep at verification. RA framing preserved throughout.

- `skills/semantic-merge/references/workflow-sync-author.md` — now owns the Workflow Sync Map and Task-Local Sync Impact format blocks inlined next to the process steps that write them. Opens with a pointer to `SKILL.md §Shared Procedure` for the shared flow. Process bullets trimmed to mode-specific content: operation run, Sync Map authorship condition, task-local annotation rule, single-commit constraint, post-sync obligation recording.

- `skills/semantic-merge/references/workflow-sync-reviewer.md` — dropped the `sync-map-format.md` load. Added a one-line pointer at the top to `workflow-sync-author.md §Workflow Sync Map Format` / `§Task-Local Sync Impact Format` for shape recognition. Process step 4 now references `SKILL.md §Shared Procedure` role-classification; added a verification step for the stale-reference sweep.

- `skills/semantic-merge/references/standalone-merge.md` — now owns the `SEMANTIC_MERGE.md` merge-record format (headers + File / Script Impact Map) inlined next to the step that writes it. Opens with a pointer to `SKILL.md §Shared Procedure`. Process bullets trimmed to mode-specific content: merge record authorship, decision logging without PLAN.md, operation run, sync commit + propagation commits, drift-test handling, stop boundary.

- `skills/semantic-merge/references/sync-quality.md` — trimmed to the gated checklist only. Opening paragraph points at `SKILL.md §Shared Procedure` for the procedure and at the owning mode references for format specs. Added checklist items for role classification, stale-reference sweep, and stash reporting so reviewers walk what the expanded procedure teaches.

- `skills/semantic-merge/references/sync-map-format.md` — deleted via `git rm`.

- `skills/handoff-doc/references/plan-anatomy.md` — §Sync Map format pointer and §Task-local Sync impact format pointer now target `workflow-sync-author.md §Workflow Sync Map Format` / `§Task-Local Sync Impact Format`. The section still carries only purpose / ownership / lifecycle / placement + one-line format pointer, preserving DRY (no re-introduced Task 3 violation).

- `skills/integration-workflow/SKILL.md` — dropped `semantic-merge/references/sync-map-format.md` from both sync-author and sync-reviewer dispatch reference lists. No other changes.
