## Task 1: Update the Codex harness adapter so superRA invocation authorizes named-agent dispatch

**Status:** Completed (Task 1 approved 2026-04-22)

### Key Findings
- `skills/using-superRA/references/codex-tools.md` now tells Codex to
  treat user-invoked superRA workflow/orchestration as explicit
  authorization for named-agent dispatch.
- The Codex adapter now states that reviewer dispatch remains mandatory
  by default and that direct mode is only a fallback when the user opts
  out, the task is trivial, or agent tools are unavailable.

### Notes
- Existing shared workflow files already carried the general
  implementer-reviewer and direct-mode rules, so no adjacent
  consistency edits were required after the adapter update.
