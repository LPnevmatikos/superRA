# superRA Design Coherence Refactor — Results

> Mirrors PLAN.md structure. Updated after each task with key findings.
> New agents: read PLAN.md for what to do, RESULTS.md for what was found.

**Last updated:** 2026-04-16 (pre-Task-1)
**Status:** In Progress

**Domain vertical:** Plugin-development (skills/hooks/docs refactor). Not a data-analysis task — no row-counts, no figures, no regression outputs. "Key Findings" captures edits made, orphan-reference grep results, and any skill-description triggering check outcomes.

## Task 1: Consolidate Stage names + remove dispatch re-statements

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

### Key Findings

**Canonical Stage set after the refactor** (matches `using-superRA` §Skill-Load Manifest 1:1): `implementation`, `refactoring`, `drift-test`, `integration-review`, `merge`, `documentation`, `planning-review`. One new manifest row added — `integration-review` — because integration review's reference set differs from `refactoring` (it runs the same loads today, but the two are semantically distinct stages and Tasks 3 / 6 will refine them independently). The `Fallback rule` that silently mapped unknown `Stage:` values to `implementation` defaults is replaced by an explicit halt-and-report policy — drift through guessed fallbacks is no longer a failure mode.

**Dispatch templates collapsed to canonical shape.** Every dispatch across `integration-workflow`, `merge-workflow`, `semantic-merge`, and `refactor-and-integrate` now emits only `Stage:` + `Task:` (+ `Git range:` for reviewers) + the "Follow the standard stage-relevant workflow" prefix + `Additionally:` steering. The redundant `Skills:` / `Domain reference(s):` / free-form context fields (`Key results to protect:`, `Tests under review:`, `Merge context:`, etc.) are gone — the manifest specifies the loads and the agent reads task content from `PLAN.md` / `RESULTS.md` directly. Dispatch-line count dropped sharply across the four skills.

**Three per-workflow Agent-Types tables deleted.** `integration-workflow` (the 8-row domain-reference table), `semantic-merge` (`## Agent Types and Domain References`), and `execution-workflow` (`## Agent Types`) all had tables enumerating what each Stage loads — those tables duplicated the manifest and were drift sources. Each is replaced with a 2-3-line `## Agent Loads` section pointing at `superRA:using-superRA` §Skill-Load Manifest and naming which manifest rows the workflow runs.

**Agent files stop loading dispatch-named references.** `agents/implementer.md` and `agents/reviewer.md` previously step-3-loaded "additional skills specified in your dispatch prompt" and step-4-loaded "the domain reference file specified in your dispatch prompt." Both steps assumed dispatches named references — they no longer do. Step 3 is rewritten to "load any additional skill the dispatch's `Additionally:` line names (rare — overrides only)." Step 4 is deleted; remaining steps renumber; the in-paragraph cross-reference updates from "step 7 below" to "step 6 below." Both agents' stage-loading paragraph is also updated: the old fallback-to-`implementation` for unknown Stages is replaced with halt-and-report.

**One description frontmatter change, one writing-skills triggering check.** Per override #3, only `skills/refactor-and-integrate/SKILL.md`'s `description:` field was modified — its old trailing enumeration listed deprecated Stage names (`drift test creation`, `drift test review`, `integration review`, `merge proposer`, `merge review`) that no longer exist anywhere in the plugin. Updated to name the canonical manifest rows (`drift-test`, `refactoring`, `integration-review`, `merge`). Triggering check: the description still fires on its original triggers — "creating drift tests", "refactoring analysis code", "writing clean merge integration commits" — so no discovery surface is lost; the change only synchronizes the enumeration with the new manifest, an inline correctness fix.

**Task 1 preserved the coupled-chain precondition.** Per override #5, the `integration-review` manifest row carries the same reference load as `refactoring` (domain §Refactor integrity; `codebase-integration.md`; `integration.md`; `integrate-drift-tests.md` if drift tests exist). Tasks 3 and 6 will refine that row later — Task 1's responsibility was only to establish the row with current loads so downstream tasks have a target to refine.

### Validation

Step-7 greps after the refactor:
- `Stage:` across `skills/` + `agents/` — every live emission is canonical: `drift-test`, `integration-review`, `refactoring`, `merge`, `documentation`. (Manifest rows: `implementation`, `refactoring`, `drift-test`, `integration-review`, `merge`, `documentation`, `planning-review`.)
- `Skills:` / `Domain reference(s):` in dispatch blocks — zero. The two remaining `Skills:` hits in the wider grep (`agent-orchestration:77`, `refactor-and-integrate:36`) are meta references describing where override lines *would* go and the fact that dispatches do not restate them; neither is a live dispatch line.
- `Agent Types` tables — zero remaining anywhere.
- Stale Stage names as live `Stage:` field emissions in dispatch blocks across `skills/` + `agents/` — zero (every `Stage:` value matches a manifest row). Stale stage-name *prose* references remain in files outside Task 1's Files-affected list: `README.md` architectural diagram (5 `Stage:` strings in the user-facing flow); role-description enumerations in `skills/agent-orchestration/SKILL.md:127`, `agents/reviewer.md:6,109`, `skills/execution-workflow/SKILL.md` graphviz labels at 69/88/89/91, `skills/report-in-markdown/SKILL.md:33`, `skills/refactor-and-integrate/SKILL.md:17,80,82`, `skills/econ-data-analysis/SKILL.md:327`, `skills/econ-data-analysis/references/integration.md:3,5`; plus the old `drift test creation` row-name in `tests/structural-invariants.sh:431,433,435`. Deferred to Task 16 Step 6 per PLAN.md (line 453 explicitly names these strings for the final sweep). Historical audit enumerations in `PLAN.md` Step 1 and release notes in `RELEASE-NOTES.md` also retain the old names, both legitimate as record.

### Notes

The `integration-review` manifest row currently replicates the `refactoring` row verbatim. Tasks 3 and 6 split and refine it. Task 6 also drops `handoff-doc` from most rows (superseded by `using-superRA` §Handoff Doc Discipline) — Task 1 leaves the `handoff-doc` loads intact because Task 6 owns that sweep.

## Task 3: Slim `econ-data-analysis/SKILL.md` + extract disciplines reference

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

### Key Findings

**Shared-base SKILL.md and role-split operational references.** `econ-data-analysis/SKILL.md` shrank from 473 lines to 276 — the full Describe / Analyze / Validate operational content (195 lines) moved to the new `references/disciplines.md`, which the **implementer loads** and the **reviewer does not**. The shared §Review & Self-Check Discipline stays in SKILL.md's main body so both roles walk the same checklist (one source of truth, two perspectives). Pitfalls, Common Rationalizations, and Red Flags stay in SKILL.md too — the reviewer needs §Pitfalls to verify operation-specific correctness (merges, lags, aggregations, filters, variable construction, missing data).

**Three-disciplines framing is now a lean summary with pointers.** The three-paragraph intro in SKILL.md replaces the prior 200-line `## Describe` / `## Analyze` / `## Validate` subsection tree. Each paragraph carries the headline rules (Iron Law for Describe; row-count MANDATORY + one-operation-per-step + sort discipline + join-type discipline for Analyze; four subdisciplines of Validate including escalation-via-AskUserQuestion) and points at `references/disciplines.md §{Describe|Analyze|Validate}` for the operational expansion. The implementer's context is split into two discoverable chunks (the shared discipline + the writing mechanics) rather than the prior 473-line wall; the reviewer's load drops to 276 lines while retaining every verification-critical section.

**§Review & Self-Check Discipline now carries `Why:` rationales on every [GATING] item.** Ten gating items across four sub-sections (Gating / Documentation-and-handoff / Refactor-integrity / Completion-verification) each gain a bulleted `*Why:*` sub-item explaining the failure mode the gate prevents — silent corruption via skipped describe, row-count drift via missing prints, merge bets against unchecked keys, chat-only findings lost at session boundaries, refactors that silently convert transparent analyses into opaque ones, re-expected drift silently changing the headline, uncommitted state that cannot be reproduced. Three `[STANDARD]` items also gained rationales where context mattered (PLAN.md-specifies handoff-doc tie-in, major-vs-minor-decision split, expectations-comparison as forcing-function). `[ADVISORY]` items stay bare. This protects against mechanical checklist-walking by reviewers — the gate tells them *what*, the rationale tells them *why*, so a novel situation can be judged rather than just matched against the line.

**§Writing Discipline absorbed into `notebook-format.md`.** The dissolved §Documentation cross-cutting writing practice section of SKILL.md landed as a new `## Writing Discipline` section in `notebook-format.md`, placed between §Markdown Cells and §Output. The absorbed content carries the markdown-cells / inline-comments / major-vs-minor-decisions / figures-pointer rules, plus a new closing paragraph that makes the major/minor split explicit ("minor decisions inside a cell document *the choice*; major decisions in a markdown cell document *the reasoning that led to the choice*. A reviewer tracing how the analysis got to its current shape reads the markdown cells first, then the code"). The prior §Short checklist per step and §Script categories paragraph from SKILL.md were deleted — the first duplicates §Review & Self-Check Discipline gates, the second is covered by `notebook-format.md`'s §When to Use.

**Manifest and agent files reflect the role split.** The `implementation` row's Stage-scoped-references cell now carries an explicit role split: implementer loads `references/disciplines.md` + `references/notebook-format.md`; reviewer loads SKILL.md only. The lede paragraph above the manifest table was updated — role differentiation now appears on two rows (`implementation` and `documentation`), not just one. Both agent files' Stage → skills paragraph and §Before You Start Step 2 were rewritten to name the exact loads per role.

### Notes on section ordering

PLAN.md Step 3's target ordering places §Review & Self-Check Discipline before §Pitfalls and §Common Rationalizations before §Red Flags. The pre-refactor file had §Review → §Common Rationalizations → §Red Flags → §Verification Checklist → §Pitfalls (in that order). Reordered the tail to match the target: §Pitfalls moved up immediately after §Review, followed by §Common Rationalizations → §Red Flags → §Key References. The §Verification Checklist stub (a one-line "see §Review & Self-Check Discipline above" pointer) was deleted — after the reorder it became a stub pointing backwards to the section right above it, serving no navigation purpose.

### Notes on line-count target

PLAN.md §Architectural design stated ~210 lines as the SKILL.md target. Final is 276 lines. The delta is driven by the `Why:` rationales on Step 4 (~30 lines added as explicit goal), a richer Stage-Scoped References table (new `disciplines.md` row + expanded role-split explanation), and the three-paragraph summary of DAV disciplines (slightly longer than the ~5 lines estimated so each paragraph can stand as a self-sufficient headline summary). The reviewer's total load is still cut roughly in half (from 473 to 276), and the implementer's total is the same as today's monolith but split into three discoverable chunks.

## Task 4: Move `script-to-notebook` into `econ-data-analysis` as a reference

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

### Key Findings

**Skill retired; content relocated under the data-analysis vertical.** The standalone `superRA:script-to-notebook` utility skill is gone — its three files (`SKILL.md` + `references/jupytext-guide.md` + `references/julia-quarto-guide.md`) moved via `git mv` into `skills/econ-data-analysis/references/`, with the old SKILL.md body landing as `notebook-format.md` (frontmatter trimmed to a one-line blockquote; title changed from "Script to Notebook" to "Notebook Format"). The directory `skills/script-to-notebook/` no longer exists. Skill inventory shrinks by one as planned.

**Manifest now carries the notebook-format reference explicitly.** The `implementation` row's Required-skills cell dropped the trailing `+ script-to-notebook` enumeration; the Stage-scoped-references cell gained `econ-data-analysis/references/notebook-format.md` as a data-analysis-specific load. The manifest remains the single source of truth — any agent dispatched at Stage `implementation` sees the notebook-format reference called out on the manifest row itself, not implied by a separate skill load.

**Active sweep — zero residual mentions outside historical records.** Post-refactor grep across `skills/`, `agents/`, `commands/`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CATEGORIES.md` shows no `script-to-notebook` matches. Eight active files updated (five SKILL.md bodies, one agent file, the README, and CATEGORIES); PLAN.md / RESULTS.md / RELEASE-NOTES.md retain the strings as historical record by design. Full file list in PLAN.md Step 5.

**Stage-Scoped References table in `econ-data-analysis/SKILL.md` is now internally consistent.** The table listed three references pre-refactor (planning, integrate-drift-tests, data-robustness-checklist) despite the file directory carrying `integration.md` (named in the manifest but missing from the table). Added both the missing `integration.md` row and the new `notebook-format.md` row; lede sentence updated from "Two companion reference files..." to "Companion reference files..." to match the now-five-row table. Each table row names its phase + purpose + companion-file relationships (notebook-format's companions `jupytext-guide.md` and `julia-quarto-guide.md` are named in its row).

### Notes on Step 1b (sequencing deviation)

PLAN.md's Step 1b expected Task 3 to have staged a `notebook-format.md.draft` file carrying the dissolved §Documentation cross-cutting writing-discipline content from the SKILL.md body. Task 3 has not run yet in the plan sequence (Tasks 1, 4, 3, 6 are the coupled chain per the Task-sequencing note; Task 4 runs second), so no draft file existed and the dispatch override instructed: proceed with Step 1 content as-is, note the absence. When Task 3 runs, its Step 2 absorbs the writing-discipline content into the now-existing `notebook-format.md` as a new "Writing Discipline" section after the cell-organization section. The `notebook-format.md` file that Task 4 leaves behind is the correct target — Task 3's implementer will find it in place.

### Reviewer note on working-tree reset

During implementation, the coordinator reported that a prior reviewer agent accidentally bundled Task 4's pre-staged file renames into one of its review commits, then soft-reset to unbundle. The result: the three file moves came back as unstaged deletes + untracked new files in the working tree. Git history was not corrupted; only the index was affected. Re-staged before committing.

## Task 8: Step 0b — explicit handoff to `planning-workflow`

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

### Key Findings

**`skills/execution-workflow/SKILL.md` Step 0b** now halts and invokes `superRA:planning-workflow` when the existence check fails, instead of inlining a bootstrap procedure. Old body (3 paragraphs: "Before any task dispatch" / "Step 0 ... Task 0 cannot silently land" / "If the docs exist, are tracked ...") → new body (2 paragraphs: the halt-and-invoke instruction + the revised Step-0 cross-reference that no longer uses "Task 0" framing). The inline "satisfy the domain-specific planning gate (for data analysis: the Data Inventory hard gate ...)" wording is gone — that work happens inside planning-workflow's Phase 1 now, not inline here.

**`skills/planning-workflow/SKILL.md` Overview** gains a second paragraph acknowledging the invocation path from execution-workflow Step 0b: "May be invoked from `execution-workflow` Step 0b when an existing branch lacks committed `PLAN.md` / `RESULTS.md` (or carries uncommitted edits to them). The bootstrap path is identical to a fresh start — run the full Phase 1 / Phase 2 / Self-Review, satisfy any domain-specific planning gate, commit the docs, and hand control back. No shortcut." The wording "no shortcut" closes the design question — there is no lightweight bootstrap mode, just the normal planning flow.

**Validation:** `grep "Task 0\b" skills/execution-workflow/SKILL.md` returns zero matches after the edit. Both skills re-read end-to-end flow cleanly — execution-workflow's failure branch becomes a one-sentence halt, and planning-workflow's overview reads as a natural entry point whether arrived-at fresh or invoked via execution-workflow.

## Task 13: Distribute `verification-before-completion` + delete the skill

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

### Key Findings

**Skill folder deleted:** `skills/verification-before-completion/SKILL.md` (143 lines) removed via `git rm -r`.

**Distribution of unique content:**

- **`agents/implementer.md` §Self-Review Before Reporting** — added the 5-step Gate Function (IDENTIFY → RUN → READ → VERIFY → claim) as a new opening subsection, followed by the bottom-line one-liner "Run the command, read the output, then claim the result." Preserved the existing Completeness / Reproducibility / Domain §Review checks beneath it.
- **`agents/implementer.md` §Pre-Commit Self-Check** — appended a red-flag wording block ("should", "probably", "seems to", "Great!", "Done!", "Perfect!") at the end of the checklist, instructing the implementer to stop and verify if any of those words show up without fresh verification evidence.
- **`agents/reviewer.md` §Verify Claims Independently** — prepended a "DO NOT take the implementer's word" paragraph with the new diff-vs-status-return framing ("check the git diff, not just the status return — agents can report 'success' for partial work").
- **`agents/reviewer.md` §Pre-Commit Self-Check** — appended the same red-flag wording block as the implementer, scoped to the reviewer's verdict instead of the commit claim.
- **`skills/refactor-and-integrate/references/drift-test-quality.md`** — added a new `## Red-Green Verification` section between Robustness and Test Format, carrying the Write → Green → Revert → Red → Restore → Green cycle with the rationale "a drift test that passes once is not verified — it might always pass."
- **`skills/execution-workflow/SKILL.md` Step 3 preamble** — inserted a bold one-sentence reminder: "Run every check. Don't trust 'looks committed' — execute `git status` and read the output. The five checks below are the orchestrator's verification gate: evidence before claims, no shortcuts."

**Reference sweep results (grep `verification-before-completion` across `skills/`, `agents/`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`):** zero matches. Also cleaned:
- `skills/using-superRA/SKILL.md` §Skill Inventory — row removed.
- `skills/CATEGORIES.md` Utility table — row removed.
- `README.md` Utility table — row removed.
- `skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md:401` — updated "TDD, verification-before-completion, designing-before-coding" to "TDD, designing-before-coding".

**Intentionally not touched:**
- `PLAN.md` (this refactor plan) and `RESULTS.md` (this dev log) retain references as historical record of the refactor.
- `docs/plans/2025-11-28-skills-improvements-from-user-feedback.md` is an archived prior plan document, not current inventory.

**Note on §Skill Types.** PLAN.md Step 7 anticipated removing the skill from a §Skill Types "Rigid" example list in `using-superRA`. That section does not currently exist in `using-superRA/SKILL.md` (removed in the pre-plan commit `956f6cc` which stripped EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT / Red Flags / Skill Types sections). The `writing-skills` Discipline-Enforcing example list was the only remaining "types-like" enumeration — updated as documented above.

## Task 15: Remove deprecated commands

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

### Key Findings

**Files deleted (3):**
- `commands/brainstorm.md` — stub pointing at `superpowers:brainstorming`.
- `commands/execute-plan.md` — stub pointing at `superpowers:executing-plans`.
- `commands/write-plan.md` — stub pointing at `superpowers:writing-plans`.

The `commands/` directory is now empty and git treats it as removed (no tracked files remain in it).

**Grep sweep (`execute-plan|write-plan|brainstorm` across `skills/`, `commands/`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `CATEGORIES.md`, `agents/`, `hooks/`):** zero matches after the deletion. No inventory-table rows or skill-body references to clean up — the stubs were referenced only by the plugin runtime's command discovery, not by any skill body or README table.

**Intentionally not touched:**
- `RELEASE-NOTES.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` carry upstream superpowers release history mentioning these commands (lines documenting their introduction, deprecation, and removal in prior upstream versions). These are historical release records, not current inventory, so they stay. superRA's own release-note entry for this refactor lands in Task 16 Step 4.

**Task-1 overlap check:** grep surfaced no references inside any of Task 1's files (`skills/using-superRA/SKILL.md`, the 4 workflow skills, `skills/semantic-merge/SKILL.md`, `skills/refactor-and-integrate/SKILL.md`, `agents/implementer.md`, `agents/reviewer.md`). No deferred edits for Task 1 to absorb.

### Notes
The PLAN's Step 2 mentioned "Remove the 'Deprecated — use superpowers:* instead' rows from any inventory tables (likely in README.md or CHANGELOG)." None existed in superRA's README or anywhere under skill / agent / command files — the stubs self-describe their deprecation in their own frontmatter only. Clean deletion.

## Task 17: Document agent-reuse vs fresh-dispatch heuristic in agent-orchestration

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

### Key Findings

**New subsection in `skills/agent-orchestration/SKILL.md`.** `## Agent reuse vs fresh dispatch` placed between `## Decision Framework` and `## Dispatch Templates`. The two sections answer orthogonal questions: Decision Framework picks the dispatch *pattern* (parallel / teams / relay); the new section picks agent *identity* within a chosen pattern (reuse a warm agent via `SendMessage` vs spawn fresh vs bundle several small tasks into one dispatch). No content overlap with the existing parallel/teams/relay table.

**Six labeled paragraphs** (bolded lead-ins, so an orchestrator can skim): Context-reload cost (names the specific loads a fresh dispatch re-pays: `using-superRA`, active domain skill, module-level `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `README.md` walk-up); Criteria favoring reuse (small scope + same domain context + non-overlapping file set + sequential build-on-previous — all four should hold); Criteria favoring fresh dispatch (any one of: new scope, different domain vertical, file-set overlap with in-flight work, warm agent cannot provide the needed perspective); Bundling as a third option (multi-task brief in a single implementer dispatch, amortizes one context load across several tiny tasks); Reviewer-always-fresh rule; `SendMessage` mechanic pointer.

**Reviewer-always-fresh rule is hard, not soft.** Anchored to `superRA:using-superRA` §Reviewer–Orchestrator Dynamic and the plugin `CLAUDE.md` Workflow principle #1. Rationale in the subsection: the adversarial-review property collapses the moment the reviewer has already committed to a line of thinking about the code — warm-agent review is equivalent to self-review and voids the implementer–reviewer pair. The rule overrides every other reuse criterion; if it is a review pass, dispatch fresh.

**Cross-reference in `skills/execution-workflow/SKILL.md`.** Single line appended to §Per-Task Execution Steps step 1 (the dispatch-implementer step — where the reuse decision actually fires): "See `superRA:agent-orchestration` §Agent reuse vs fresh dispatch for when to reuse a warm implementer via `SendMessage` versus spawning a fresh dispatch." No heuristic content duplicated; pointer only.

### Validation

End-to-end re-read of `agent-orchestration/SKILL.md`: new subsection slots between §Decision Framework (ends with the rule-of-thumb paragraph) and §Dispatch Templates (opens with the canonical-shape intro) without disrupting the existing flow. Covers the orthogonal axis of agent-identity selection that §Decision Framework does not address. No duplication with the parallel/teams/relay table.

End-to-end re-read of `execution-workflow/SKILL.md` §Per-Task Execution Steps: the one-line pointer lands on step 1 (implementer dispatch) and does not step on steps 2–4 (NEEDS_CONTEXT / BLOCKED handling, reviewer dispatch — which by the new hard rule is always fresh, and final APPROVE handoff). The pointer is additive, not conflicting.

No skill-description frontmatter changed — triggering checks not needed for this task.

### Notes

**Concurrency with Task 6.** At dispatch time the orchestrator flagged that another implementer was running Task 6, which edits `skills/execution-workflow/SKILL.md` in multiple places. `git diff` on my target file before commit showed only my single-line addition to step 1 of §Per-Task Execution Steps — no overlap with Task 6's in-flight edits. `skills/agent-orchestration/SKILL.md` was untouched by any other in-flight work.

**Does not subsume the Decision Framework.** The new section does not replace or compete with §Decision Framework; the two compose. An orchestrator first picks the dispatch pattern (parallel / teams / relay / single), then asks the reuse-vs-fresh question within that pattern.
