## Task 1: Update the Codex instructions surface for dispatch, warm-agent lifecycle, and load semantics

**Status:** Completed (Task 1 integration follow-up approved 2026-04-22)

### Key Findings
- `skills/using-superRA/references/codex-instructions.md` now tells
  Codex to treat user-invoked superRA workflow/orchestration as
  explicit authorization for named-agent dispatch.
- The Codex adapter now states that reviewer dispatch remains mandatory
  by default and that direct mode is only a fallback when the user opts
  out, the task is trivial, or agent tools are unavailable.
- The Codex adapter now also says that long-running warm agents are
  normal, should not be shut down eagerly, and can be contacted with
  warm-agent messaging when the orchestrator needs to steer a running
  subagent.
- `skills/using-superRA/SKILL.md` now explicitly tells Codex agents to
  load `references/codex-instructions.md` whenever they load the master
  skill, so the Codex instructions surface is no longer only implied by
  the harness-adapter note.

### Notes
- Existing shared workflow files already carried the general
  implementer-reviewer and direct-mode rules, so no adjacent
  consistency rewrites were needed beyond one root-doc audit fix in
  `CLAUDE.md`, which now points contributors at the current adapter
  reference pattern and names `codex-instructions.md` explicitly.
