# superRA

superRA is a complete economic research workflow for AI coding agents, built as a fork of [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers). It turns your coding agent into a disciplined Research Assistant that follows data-first principles, enforces reproducibility, and maintains full session-to-session handoff — so you never lose work when context runs out.

## Why superRA?

AI agents are eager but undisciplined. They skip data description, merge without checking row counts, and declare "looks fine" without verification. In economic research, these shortcuts produce wrong results that look right.

superRA enforces a single non-negotiable rule — the **Iron Law of Data Analysis**:

> **NO TRANSFORMATION WITHOUT PRIOR DESCRIPTION**

Every data operation follows a Describe-Analyze-Doc cycle. Every task gets a two-stage review (data integrity, then implementation correctness). Every session leaves enough state in PLAN.md and RESULTS_UPDATE.md that a fresh agent can pick up exactly where the last one stopped.

## How It Works

superRA activates automatically. When your agent sees a research task, it doesn't jump into code — it follows a four-phase macro workflow: **PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → INTEGRATE**.

```
PLAN            data-exploration → analysis-planning
                Inventory data (hard gate). Break work into tasks with code at every step.
                Output: PLAN.md + RESULTS_UPDATE.md (living handoff documents)
                    |
IMPLEMENT       executing-analysis (implementer agent per task)
                Follow econ-data-analysis discipline: Describe → Analyze → Doc.
                Atomic commit per task: code + PLAN.md status + RESULTS_UPDATE.md findings.
                    |
VALIDATE        executing-analysis (reviewer agent after each task)
                Two-stage review: data integrity → implementation correctness.
                REVISE loops until APPROVED. Review is never skipped.
                    |
INTEGRATE       finishing-analysis → pre-merge-gate → semantic-merge
                Verify reproducibility. Create drift tests. Refactor for codebase.
                Integration review. Generate report. Merge or PR.
```

Each task produces an atomic commit. If the session dies at any point, the next session reads PLAN.md + RESULTS_UPDATE.md + git state and picks up exactly where the last one stopped.

### Claude Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FuZhiyu/econ-superpowers.git
# Then add as a local plugin in your project's .claude/settings.json
```

### Other Platforms

See the upstream [Superpowers docs](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) for plugin installation patterns on Cursor, Codex, Copilot CLI, and Gemini CLI. Point them at this repo instead of the upstream.

## Skills

### Core Discipline (loaded by every agent)

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **econ-data-analysis** | Iron Law enforcement. Describe-Analyze-Doc cycle. Pitfall checklists for merges, aggregations, filtering, variable construction. |
| **verification-before-completion** | No completion claims without fresh verification evidence. Prevents "looks fine" from reaching merge. |

### PLAN Phase

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **data-exploration** | Inventory available data, identify gaps, research sources. Hard gate: no analysis starts without approved inventory. |
| **analysis-planning** | Create step-by-step plans with actual code. Every step has describe-validate discipline. Plans are living handoff documents. |

### IMPLEMENT + VALIDATE Phase

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **executing-analysis** | Dispatch implementer agent per task, reviewer agent after each. Two-stage review (data integrity then implementation). Falls back to direct execution when requested. |
| **requesting-analysis-review** | Ad-hoc single-pass review for quick checks, before-merge verification, or when data looks unexpected. |
| **receiving-code-review** | Technical evaluation of review feedback. Verify before implementing. No performative agreement. |

### INTEGRATE Phase

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **finishing-analysis** | Verify reproducibility, generate work journal, present options: merge locally, push & PR, keep branch, or discard. |
| **pre-merge-gate** | Create drift tests to protect key results. Refactor code for integration. Integration review with iteration. |
| **semantic-merge** | Intent-based branch integration. Classifies conflicts by research impact. Escalates methodology decisions to user. |

### Infrastructure

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **using-analysis-worktrees** | Isolated git worktrees with data seeding. Parallel analysis without branch switching. |
| **worktree-data-sync** | Sync non-git data between worktrees (seed, diff, apply modes). |
| **agent-orchestration** | Multi-agent dispatch: parallel subagents for independent tasks, Agent Teams for iterative workflows. |
| **reviewer-protocol** | Alias skill for direct mode — loads the reviewer agent protocol when the main agent reviews work itself. |
| **implementer-protocol** | Alias skill for direct mode — loads the implementer agent protocol when the main agent implements work itself. |

### Meta

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **using-superRA** | Session startup. Cross-session detection. Skill discovery and activation rules. |
| **writing-skills** | Create new skills using test-driven methodology. |

## Agents

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **reviewer** | Prototype reviewer agent. Verifies work independently using APPROVE/REVISE protocol. Dispatched with a skill and domain reference per stage. |
| **implementer** | Prototype implementer agent. Executes tasks with data-first discipline. Dispatched with a skill and domain reference per stage. |

## Key Design Decisions

**Agent-owned doc updates.** Each agent commits its doc changes atomically with its work. The implementer commits code + PLAN.md status + RESULTS_UPDATE.md findings in a single commit. Reviewers commit review notes and APPROVED status separately. No orchestrator transcription step.

**Review status protocol.** Tasks in PLAN.md carry a status line: `IMPLEMENTED` (code done, awaiting review), `REVISE (data integrity)` or `REVISE (implementation)` (reviewer found issues — data integrity REVISE blocks implementation review from starting), `APPROVED` (both reviews passed). A fresh session can tell exactly where each task stands.

**Two-stage review.** Data integrity first, implementation correctness second. Data review must pass before implementation review begins. Review is never skipped — even in direct execution mode.

**Scope rule.** Agents only edit their own task's sections in PLAN.md and RESULTS_UPDATE.md. Never touch other tasks.

**RA framing.** The agent is a Research Assistant implementing the researcher's ideas, not judging methodology. It executes, validates, and escalates — but the researcher decides the approach.

**Lean agent definitions.** Two prototype agents (implementer, reviewer) define roles, not rules. Domain-specific checklists come from reference files read at dispatch time. Every agent loads `superRA:econ-data-analysis` via the Skill tool for data discipline. One source of truth, easy to maintain.

## Hooks

| Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **session-start** | Session start, `/clear`, `/compact` | Inject using-superRA skill, check for Agent Teams availability |
| **merge-guard** | Before any `git merge/rebase/cherry-pick` | Remind to use semantic-merge skill |

## Philosophy

- **Data-first** — Understand before transforming. Always.
- **Reproducibility is a requirement** — Drift tests, pipeline files, committed code. Not optional.
- **Evidence over claims** — Run the pipeline before saying it works.
- **Session resilience** — PLAN.md + RESULTS_UPDATE.md + git = complete handoff.
- **Researcher decides, agent implements** — Methodology is not the agent's call.
