# These are the plugin's analogue of drift tests: they verify that the
# shape of the plugin (skill registry, cross-references, hook config,
# workflow-principle ordering in CLAUDE.md, load-bearing invariants)
# still holds after a structural change.
#
# Exit 0 = all invariants pass. Exit >0 = one or more failures.
# Known pre-existing warnings (broken upstream refs in writing-skills)
# are reported as WARN, not FAIL, so CI stays green until they're
