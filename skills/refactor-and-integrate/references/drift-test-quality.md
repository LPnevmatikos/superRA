# Drift Test Quality Standards

Shared domain reference for drift test creation and review. Both the implementer (test creator) and reviewer use this checklist.

## Coverage

- [ ] Every user-confirmed key result has at least one test
- [ ] Main findings (coefficients, magnitudes, significance) tested
- [ ] Sample statistics (observation counts, unique entities) tested where they define the analysis scope
- [ ] No key result skipped or left unprotected
- [ ] Focus on KEY results — findings that define analysis conclusions, not every intermediate number

## Tolerance Calibration

Set tolerances based on **economic reasoning**, not arbitrary thresholds.

**Point estimates** (coefficients, means, portfolio returns):
- Allow minor variation from data ordering, floating-point arithmetic, rounding
- Typical tolerance: 1-5% of estimate magnitude, or a few units in the last reported decimal place

**Standard errors:**
- Wider tolerance than point estimates — sensitive to small changes in sample composition, clustering, numerical precision
- Typical tolerance: 5-10% of the standard error

**Counts and categoricals** (observations, firms, periods):
- Exact or near-exact — should not change unless sample construction changes
- Tolerance: 0 or very small integer

**Signs and significance:**
- Write directional tests ("coefficient is positive", "t-statistic exceeds 1.96") in addition to magnitude tests
- These catch the most important drift — sign flip or significance loss

**Too tight** → false positives on harmless changes (merge order, floating-point platform differences).
**Too loose** → misses real drift. Use economic judgment.

**Document every tolerance choice** with a comment explaining why:
```
# Coefficient on market_cap: 0.035 +/- 0.002
# Tolerance: ~5% of estimate. Allows for floating-point variation
# in OLS solver but catches meaningful coefficient drift.
```

## Independence

- [ ] Tests can run without re-executing the full analysis pipeline
- [ ] Tests load from saved outputs (files, serialized objects)
- [ ] Test file is self-contained and executable on its own
- [ ] Dependencies are minimal and clearly stated

## Clarity

- [ ] Test names describe what result they protect (e.g., `test_market_cap_coefficient_sign_and_magnitude`)
- [ ] Tests grouped logically (main regression results together, sample statistics together)
- [ ] Header comment explains the analysis being protected and when tests were created
- [ ] A new contributor could understand what each test guards

## Robustness

- [ ] Tests would not break from irrelevant changes (file moves, comment edits, import reordering)
- [ ] Tests reference stable output locations
- [ ] Floating-point comparisons use appropriate tolerance functions (`pytest.approx`, `isapprox`), not exact equality

## Red-Green Verification

A drift test that passes once is not verified — it might always pass, regardless of the condition it claims to protect. Verify every drift or regression test with the red-green cycle before committing it:

```
1. Write the test against the current (correct) output.
2. Run it — MUST PASS (green).
3. Revert the fix / perturb the input the test protects.
4. Run it — MUST FAIL (red).
5. Restore the fix / input.
6. Run it — MUST PASS again (green).
```

A test that does not turn red on step 4 is not actually guarding the result — it is a passing no-op. "I've written a regression test" without the red-green cycle is not evidence the test works.

## Test Format

Follow the project's testing conventions:
- Python: pytest in `tests/` directory
- Julia: Test module in `test/` directory
- Match naming and structure patterns of existing tests
- If no existing tests: use standard framework conventions

## Drift Test Integrity — Cross-Cutting Red Flags

These rules apply wherever drift tests are in play — during creation (`integration-workflow` Stage 1), after any refactor (`integration-workflow` Stage 2), after a main update (`merge-workflow` Step 2), and after any `semantic-merge` operation. The workflow skills point at this section rather than restate the rules locally.

**Never:**
- **Silently update drift test expectations for meaningful result changes.** A test failure after a refactor, merge, or rebase means one of three things: (a) the change broke something and must be fixed, (b) the change revealed a tolerance too tight and must be justified with economic reasoning and an `AskUserQuestion` confirmation from the researcher, or (c) the change meaningfully shifted a result, which is a research conversation with the researcher — surface it via `AskUserQuestion` (plain text fallback when unavailable), log the answer per `handoff-doc` §User Decisions Log, and commit the log entry before updating the expectation. Never a silent expectation bump.
- **Proceed past failing drift tests without assessment.** Failing tests block the workflow until explicitly adjudicated.
- **Remove or weaken existing drift tests during refactoring or merge integration.** Tests are part of the analysis contract.
- **Treat the drift tests as the only safety net.** They protect key results; they do not replace the one-pass review or the data-discipline protocol.

When a drift test fails, follow the orchestrator discipline in `superRA:agent-orchestration` §Handling Reviewer Feedback — read the cited output, classify the failure, and either fix, justify, or escalate.
