# Skill Categories

superRA skills split into four categories. The directory layout stays flat (one `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` per skill) for compatibility with Claude Code, Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, and Codex skill loaders. This file is the authoritative grouping index — when adding a skill, place it in the right category here and in the `README.md` skill tables.

For the runtime-facing master map (universal principles, skill-discovery rules, and the Stage → required-skills / references table agents actually load), see `superRA:using-superra` §Skill Inventory and §Skill-Load Manifest. This file groups skills for contributor navigation; `using-superra` is the agent-facing authority.

## Workflow — domain-agnostic choreography

Own the procedural shape of each phase: what agent to dispatch, in what sequence, with what handoff rules. Every workflow skill is domain-neutral — when a task is data analysis (the currently-implemented vertical), the workflow skill instructs the agent to load the matching domain skill. Adding a new vertical means adding a domain skill, not forking these.

| Skill | Phase | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `planning-workflow` | PLAN | Scope check, task decomposition, self-review, execution handoff. Points at the domain skill for domain-specific planning gates. |
| `implementation-workflow` | IMPLEMENT + VALIDATE | Per-task dispatch, one-pass review loop (APPROVE / REVISE), reproducibility verification, 4-option completion menu. |
| `integration-workflow` | INTEGRATE | Protect key results with drift tests, Sync with the current base, Integrate/refactor the post-sync diff, Document final results, then Finish with PR / fast-forward / cleanup. |
| `agent-orchestration` | cross-cutting | Multi-agent dispatch patterns: workload balancing, parallel subagents, reviewer-feedback adjudication. |

## Domain — vertical-specific discipline

Carry the domain-specific knowledge that workflow skills invoke when a task touches that domain. Organized by reference files split by stage so the right chunk loads at the right phase. Today's only vertical is data analysis; the architecture is designed to grow.

| Skill | Vertical | Flagship discipline |
|---|---|---|
| `econ-data-analysis` | Data analysis | Iron Law (no transformation without prior description), three concurrent disciplines (describe-analyze-validate), diagnostics-for-validity philosophy, pitfall catalogs, common rationalizations. Stage-scoped references: `planning.md`, `integrate-drift-tests.md`, `integration.md`, `data-robustness-checklist.md`, `notebook-format.md` (+ `jupytext-guide.md` and `julia-quarto-guide.md` companions). |

### Future verticals (roadmap — not yet implemented)

- **Theory / modeling** — derivation discipline, notation consistency, proof checks
- **Literature review** — citation integrity, claim-evidence mapping
- **Simulation** — seed discipline, sensitivity to parameter grids, stochastic reproducibility
- **Writing / paper drafting** — figure/table consistency, cross-reference integrity, narrative coherence

Each future vertical plugs into the same workflow scaffolding — implementer + reviewer pair, handoff docs, autonomous-with-human-in-loop, semantic merges.

## Utility — reusable, domain-neutral tools

Agent-facing and standalone-invokable. Called by workflow skills and agent files as needed. Domain-agnostic; reusable across verticals.

| Skill | What it provides |
|---|---|
| `handoff-doc` | Handoff-doc discipline — four document principles, inline-edit rule, stale-content checklist, User Decisions Log format, figure-embedding pointer, full `PLAN.md` / `RESULTS.md` anatomy templates (`plan-anatomy.md`, `results-anatomy.md`). Loaded on demand when the compact etiquette in `agents/implementer.md` / `agents/reviewer.md` step 1 is not enough, and always by doc-creators (`planning-workflow` Phase 2, `integration-workflow` Document doc-writer). Usable standalone by a single author with no subagents. |
| `refactor-and-integrate` | Drift-test quality, post-sync codebase integration, project-doc audit, Sync Map propagation, and minimum surviving branch delta. Loaded by integration-phase agents. |
| `report-in-markdown` | Format discipline for markdown reports — figures, LaTeX math, tables. Progressive-reveal references by stage. |
| `semantic-merge` | Intent-based semantic sync for any vertical or caller. Resolves conflicts by intent, escalates research-meaningful decisions to the user, lands the sync commit, and records a Sync Map. Invoked by `integration-workflow` Sync; usable standalone by a human, orchestrator, or dispatched agent. |
| `worktree-data-sync` | Non-git data sync between existing worktrees (seed, diff, apply) and data teardown. Worktree lifecycle is in `agent-orchestration/references/worktree-harness-fallback.md`. |

## Meta — system-level

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `using-superra` | Master skill every agent reads. Carries the distilled universal principles, code-change defaults, the Workflow / Domain / Utility / Meta skill inventory, the composable-design map, the Skill-Load Manifest (Stage → required skills + stage-scoped references), and the Execution Modes (subagent dispatch vs direct). Main-agent loads (cross-session detection, autonomy contract, handoff-doc default) live in `references/main-agent.md`. |

## Adding a Skill

1. Decide the category above. If it doesn't fit cleanly, it may belong in two places — default to the category that matches its primary caller (workflow-skills are called by orchestrators; domain-skills are called by workflow-skills; utility-skills are called by agent files and by other skills).
2. Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (flat layout — no nested folders).
3. Add a row to the table above and to the matching table in `README.md`.
4. If it's a domain skill, design its `references/` folder around workflow phases so agents can load the right chunk per stage.
