description: "Use when about to run `git merge`, `git rebase`, or `git cherry-pick` on a research branch — or any time incoming changes from another branch may touch results-bearing files, analysis scripts, PLAN.md, RESULTS.md, drift tests, or domain-discipline artifacts — and you want thoughtful, research-aware conflict resolution rather than mechanical ours/theirs. Triggers include: bare `git merge` / `git rebase` / `git cherry-pick` on a research branch (the merge-guard hook flags these automatically), \"pull main into this branch\", \"rebase onto main\", \"cherry-pick commit X\", or any merge where at least one hunk touches a results-bearing file. Invoked by `integration-workflow` Phase B Step 3 mechanical-merge commit when conflicts or material main-side changes exist; also usable standalone by any agent or human doing a research-aware merge."

# Semantic Merge

Integrate branches by intent, not by lines. Understand what each side was trying to achieve, synthesize where both changes are valid, escalate research-meaningful decisions to the user, and verify the integrated result.

**Core principle:** Treat conflicts as intent conflicts first and line conflicts second. Research-meaningful conflicts always go to the user. The agent implements the researcher's integration decisions — never judges methodology.

**Exception — orchestrator-managed parallel worktrees bypass this skill.** Branches matching `<branch>/parallel/<slug>` merge with plain `git merge --no-ff`. The `merge-guard` hook exempts `*/parallel/*` source refs.

## The Process

### Step 1: Ground in repo state

Before changing anything:

```bash
git status
git branch --show-current
git log --oneline -5

MERGE_BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD <incoming-branch>)
git log --oneline $MERGE_BASE..<incoming-branch>
git diff --name-only $MERGE_BASE..<incoming-branch>
```

If the worktree is dirty, preserve it safely first:

```bash
git stash push -m "pre-merge snapshot"
```

Stop and clarify only if the repository is already mid-operation in a way that makes intent ambiguous.

### Step 2: Understand incoming intent

Read commit messages and diffs since the merge base. Classify changes by role:

- **Results-bearing** — domain analysis scripts, computation pipelines, anything that affects outputs
- **Domain-discipline artifacts** — validation artifacts the domain skill requires (e.g. for data analysis: describe steps, row-count logs, validation checks); drift tests
- **Handoff docs** — PLAN.md, RESULTS.md (conflicting edits to these may imply structural reorganization — see below)
- **Infrastructure** — utilities, build scripts, CI config
- **Documentation** — README, non-results docs
- **Generated outputs** — compiled artifacts, figures, tables that should be regenerated from merged sources

Do the same for the current branch if its purpose is not already obvious.

### Step 3: Build an integration map

For each overlapping area, decide one of:

- keep incoming behavior
- keep current-branch behavior
- synthesize both
- regenerate derived artifacts from merged sources
- ask the user

Prefer synthesis over picking sides when both changes are valid and compatible. Prefer regeneration over manual editing for generated files.

**PLAN.md / RESULTS.md conflicts** require extra care: a conflict here may indicate that the incoming branch reorganized a task, removed a section, or changed research scope. If the conflict implies a substantive restructure of the analysis plan, escalate to `planning-workflow §User Feedback and Changing Plans` rather than resolving it as a line conflict. The researcher decides — the agent proposes.

### Step 4: Ask the user when the semantic choice is not discoverable

Ask when:

- two different semantic integrations are both reasonable
- the incoming and current changes point toward different valid research goals, methodological choices, or scope decisions (e.g. scope-defining variables, key model specifications, data sources, research conclusions)
- incoming and current changes point in opposite architectural directions
- a PLAN.md conflict implies a substantive restructure of scope or task ordering

Do not ask for conflicts that can be resolved by inspecting the repo, commit range, tests, or docs.

**Present ambiguity in terms of intent and consequences**, not raw diff chunks:
- Bad: "Lines 42-58 conflict between HEAD and incoming"
- Good: "Incoming changes redefine how the outcome variable is constructed. Your branch uses this in the main analysis. Keep yours / adopt theirs / investigate impact?"

**Log every user decision** per `handoff-doc §User Decisions Log` and include the log entry in the commit that implements it. If PLAN.md is absent, record the decision in the merge commit message instead — the commit message is the record of record once the doc is gone.

### Step 5: Resolve conflicts and integrate

A common workflow: one **mechanical merge commit** (lowest-assumption reconciliation that preserves information and restores a coherent tree) followed by one or more **integration commits** (adapt code, docs, tests, and generated artifacts so the branch meaningfully incorporates the incoming objective — rewrite stale names, paths, and references; regenerate derived outputs from merged sources).

This 1+N shape is **one possible workflow**, not mandatory. Callers may collapse to a single commit when adaptation is trivial, or may split integration work into parallel commits across independent task areas.

If rebase or cherry-pick is required instead of merge, preserve the same conceptual separation: land incoming changes cleanly first, then make a dedicated integration commit unless the user explicitly wants one combined commit.

### Step 6: Verify the integrated result

- Run targeted checks for touched subsystems.
- Run drift tests if the branch has them. Load `refactor-and-integrate/references/drift-test-quality.md` before running — failing drift tests after a merge must be adjudicated (present before/after values, assess significance, stop for user decision on meaningful drift), never silently re-expected. Failing tests that are purely mechanical (a path rename, a renamed function with identical behavior) may be updated with a documented reason.
- Search for stale references, outdated labels, old paths, inconsistent docs, and generated outputs that should have been regenerated.
- Confirm the final tree reflects the integrated intent, not just a conflict-free state.

**If called from `integration-workflow` Phase B Step 3 as the mechanical-merge commit**: the caller runs drift tests and post-merge verification — you complete the merge and report back; do not duplicate the caller's verification pass.

## What to Report

When the integration is complete, summarize:

- The incoming branch's objective
- How it interacted with the current branch's work
- What was kept from each side, what was synthesized or regenerated
- What questions were asked (and the user's answers) because intent was unclear
- Drift test and verification results

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Run bare `git merge` without inspecting incoming intent first on a research branch
- Choose `--ours` or `--theirs` for results-bearing files without user input
- Resolve domain-discipline conflicts without presenting options to the user
- Judge the researcher's methodology — you integrate; you do not evaluate
- Discard dirty worktree state without explicit approval
- Silently update drift-test expectations after a meaningful result change

**Always:**
- Understand incoming intent before resolving conflicts
- Prefer synthesis over picking sides when both changes are valid
- Escalate research-meaningful conflicts to the user with intent and consequences, not raw diffs
- Run drift tests on the merged result when the branch has them (unless the caller, e.g. `integration-workflow` Phase B, owns that verification pass)
- Preserve and re-validate domain-discipline artifacts through the merge
- Log every user decision per `handoff-doc §User Decisions Log`
