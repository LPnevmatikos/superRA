name: integration-workflow
description: Use when an analysis is code-complete and reproducibility-verified and the user has chosen to merge back or open a PR; when you need drift tests to guard key results before they touch main; when analysis code needs a refactor pass to fit existing codebase conventions before integration; when the Stage 1 dev-log RESULTS.md still needs to be matured into its permanent, fact-checked, co-located form (Stage 2); when project-level CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / README.md need updating to reflect the new code; when PLAN.md needs final disposition before merge. Triggers include "prepare this for merge", "write drift tests for the key results", "refactor this to match the codebase style", "consolidate RESULTS.md", "mature the results document", "update project docs for this analysis", "get this ready to PR", or the transition from `execution-workflow`'s completion menu (options 1 or 2). Sits at the INTEGRATE phase, step 1 of 2; hands off to `merge-workflow` for the main update and actual merge/PR.

# Integration Workflow

Workflow skill for the **INTEGRATE** phase of the superRA workflow. Owns the three steps that prepare an analysis branch for merging into main: protect results with drift tests (Stage 1), refactor code for codebase integration (Stage 2), and finalize all documentation for merge — mature RESULTS.md into its Stage 2 permanent form, audit project-level docs (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / README.md), and dispose of PLAN.md (Step 3). Hands off the actual merge/PR mechanics to `superRA:merge-workflow`.

Assumes execution-workflow has already verified reproducibility and the user has chosen Option 1 (merge locally) or Option 2 (push + PR). If you find yourself running reproducibility checks or presenting the 4-option menu, something is wrong: that work belongs in execution-workflow.

**Core principle:** Tests guard results. Integration review identifies what needs changing. Refactoring addresses specific issues. Before merge, every doc lands in its final form through a dedicated doc-writer + doc-reviewer pair: RESULTS.md matures from dev log into a permanent co-located record, project docs are brought into sync with the new code, and PLAN.md is disposed of. Nothing hands off to merge-workflow without integration reviewer approval on the refactored code (Stage 2) AND doc-reviewer approval on the matured RESULTS.md + project docs (Step 3).

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the integration-workflow skill to prepare this work for integration."

**Autonomy:** this workflow has exactly four legitimate stop points — drift-test candidate confirmation (Stage 1 Step 2), meaningful drift escalation after refactoring (Stage 2 / "Handling Drift Test Failures"), Stage 2 RESULTS.md relocation target if project guidance does not specify one (Step 3 sub-part A), and PLAN.md disposition (Step 3 sub-part C). Between those, run on your own power: do not check in after each stage, do not ask "ready to move to the next step?", do not re-confirm a reviewer's APPROVE. See CLAUDE.md workflow principle #4 for the full autonomy rule and `handoff-doc` §User Decisions Log for how the answer at each stop point must be recorded in PLAN.md before the workflow acts on it.

## Dispatch Convention

Every dispatch in this skill uses the pointer-based template — pass only the stage label, the domain reference path, and any task-specific pointers (key results, code under review, prior reviewer findings). The `implementer` and `reviewer` agent definitions own the report format, handoff protocol, and skill-load defaults; do not duplicate that content into the dispatch prompt. Stage-driven auto-loads (including the domain skill and any stage-scoped references) are defined in `agents/implementer.md` / `agents/reviewer.md` Stage tables — dispatches do not restate them.

When a reviewer returns REVISE in either stage, **adjudicate the feedback before forwarding it.** See "Handling Reviewer Feedback (Orchestrator Discipline)" in `superRA:execution-workflow` for the protocol — the same discipline applies here. You are the senior researcher; the reviewer is an advisor. Read the cited code, classify each issue, override with documented reasoning if the reviewer is wrong, push back with counter-evidence if the reviewer misread the code.

## Stage 1: Drift Test Creation

Drift tests guard key results from unintended changes during refactoring or future modifications. They are the safety net that makes refactoring safe.

### Steps

1. **Extract key results from RESULTS.md.** Read the results document and use economic reasoning to identify KEY results -- main findings that define the analysis conclusions, not every intermediate number.

2. **Present candidates to user via `AskUserQuestion`** (plain text if unavailable). This is a legitimate stop point — drift-test coverage is a researcher-owned decision because it encodes what counts as a "key result" worth protecting. Show the candidates with their values and let the researcher confirm, add, or remove:
   ```
   These results seem like the key findings to protect with drift tests:
   - [result 1: description and value]
   - [result 2: description and value]
   - ...

   Which of these should be protected? Any to add or remove?
   ```
   The answer is a user decision — log it in the top-level `## Decisions` section of `PLAN.md` (or inside the task block whose results are being protected, if the list is task-scoped) per `handoff-doc` §User Decisions Log, and commit the PLAN.md edit **before** dispatching the test-creator. The `ask-user-question-logger` hook will remind you.

3. **Dispatch test-creator:**
   ```
   Agent(subagent_type: "superRA:implementer"):
     Stage: drift test creation
     Skills: superRA:refactor-and-integrate
     Domain references: drift-test-quality.md (refactor-and-integrate) + integrate-drift-tests.md (econ-data-analysis)
     Key results to protect: [user-confirmed list with values]
     Test conventions: [project test framework, test directory]
     Additionally: Follow the standard stage-relevant workflow and load
       relevant skills and documents to proceed. Additionally,
       <optional steering — e.g., tolerance conventions specific to this
       analysis, prior-round adjudication if this is a re-dispatch>.
   ```

4. **Dispatch test-reviewer:**
   ```
   Agent(subagent_type: "superRA:reviewer"):
     Stage: drift test
     Skills: superRA:refactor-and-integrate
     Domain references: drift-test-quality.md (refactor-and-integrate) + integrate-drift-tests.md (econ-data-analysis)
     Tests under review: [paths to created test files]
     Key results they should protect: [list]
     Additionally: Follow the standard stage-relevant workflow and load
       relevant skills and documents to proceed. Additionally,
       <optional steering>.
   ```

5. **If REVISE:** adjudicate the reviewer's issues per the orchestrator discipline above. For accepted issues, re-dispatch the test-creator with the specific feedback. Re-dispatch the test-reviewer. Iterate until APPROVE.

6. **Run tests to establish green baseline.** All drift tests must pass on the current code before proceeding. If tests fail on the existing code, the tests are wrong -- fix them.

7. **Commit test files.**
   ```bash
   git add tests/
   git commit -m "add drift tests for key analysis results"
   ```

## Stage 2: Integration Review → Refactor Loop

The integration reviewer is the gatekeeper. Review first to identify what needs changing, then refactor to address specific issues. Nothing moves forward without integration reviewer approval.

### Steps

1. **Identify existing codebase conventions.** Read:
   - CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or project configuration for coding standards
   - Existing code in the repository for naming patterns, file organization, utility functions
   - Available utility functions that the new code should adopt

2. **Dispatch integration-reviewer:**
   ```
   Agent(subagent_type: "superRA:reviewer"):
     Stage: integration review
     Skills: superRA:refactor-and-integrate
     Domain reference: active domain skill's §Refactor integrity (for data analysis: `econ-data-analysis/SKILL.md` §Review & Self-Check Discipline §Refactor integrity) + codebase-integration.md (cross-cutting code-quality checklist)
     Code under review: [paths]
     Codebase conventions: [where they're documented — CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, etc.]
     Drift tests: [paths]
     Diff: <BASE_SHA>..<HEAD_SHA>
     Additionally: Follow the standard stage-relevant workflow and load
       relevant skills and documents to proceed. Additionally,
       <optional steering>.
   ```

3. **If APPROVE:** No refactoring needed. Proceed to final commit.

4. **If REVISE:** Adjudicate the reviewer's feedback per the orchestrator discipline above. For accepted issues, refactor:

   a. **Dispatch refactorer:**
      ```
      Agent(subagent_type: "superRA:implementer"):
        Stage: refactoring
        Skills: superRA:refactor-and-integrate
        Domain reference: active domain skill's §Refactor integrity (for data analysis: `econ-data-analysis/SKILL.md` §Review & Self-Check Discipline §Refactor integrity) + codebase-integration.md (cross-cutting code-quality checklist)
        Reviewer issues to address: [accepted items, file:line, what to fix]
        Codebase conventions: [pointers]
        Drift tests: [paths — must keep passing]
        Code to refactor: [paths]
        Additionally: Follow the standard stage-relevant workflow and load
          relevant skills and documents to proceed. Additionally,
          <optional steering — e.g., prior-round adjudication, items the
          orchestrator has rejected vs. accepted>.
      ```

   b. **After refactoring: run drift tests.**
      - **Pass:** Commit and re-submit for review.
      - **Fail:** Assess economic significance of the drift.
        - **Meaningful drift** (results change substantively): STOP. Show the user before/after values and ask how to proceed. Do not silently accept changed results.
        - **Minor variation** (rounding, floating-point, inconsequential magnitude change): Update test expectations with the new values, document the reason in a comment, and proceed.

   c. **Commit refactored code.**
      ```bash
      git add -A
      git commit -m "refactor analysis code for codebase integration"
      ```

   d. **Re-dispatch integration-reviewer.** Loop back to step 2. Iterate until APPROVE.

5. **Final commit** after integration reviewer APPROVE.
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "address integration review feedback"
   ```

## Step 3: Documentation Finalization

After Stage 2 APPROVES the refactored code, every doc needs to land in its final shape before merge: `RESULTS.md` matures from dev log to permanent record, project-level docs (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `README.md`) are brought into sync with the new code, and `PLAN.md` is disposed of. This step gates the entire documentation pass behind a **single implementer-reviewer pair** — a dispatched doc-writer subagent performs sub-parts A and B, a dispatched doc-reviewer subagent gates both together, and the orchestrator handles the user-facing decisions (relocation target, PLAN.md disposition) on either side of the subagent cycle.

Why a doc-writer subagent and not orchestrator-performed: workflow principle P1 requires an enforced implementer-reviewer pair at every step. Having the orchestrator do the consolidation and then dispatching only a reviewer is a reviewer-only gate, not a pair. The doc-writer subagent closes that gap and keeps Step 3 consistent with the rest of the workflow.

The format discipline for sub-part A lives entirely in `superRA:report-in-markdown`. This step orchestrates and dispatches; it does not duplicate the rules.

### Orchestrator preamble: resolve RESULTS_DIR

The matured `RESULTS.md` lands in the analysis's permanent code folder, **per project guidance**. Before dispatching the doc-writer, read `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or the project README for the convention. If none exists, this is a legitimate stop point — ask the researcher via `AskUserQuestion` (plain text if unavailable):

```
Stage 2 RESULTS.md needs a permanent location in this project. The matured
file will be co-located with the analysis code so it travels with it.
Where should it land?

Suggested: <best guess from the analysis code's location, e.g. analyses/<name>/>
```

Log the answer in the top-level `## Decisions` section of `PLAN.md` per `handoff-doc` §User Decisions Log **before** dispatching the doc-writer. If a project convention exists in the guidance files, use it directly without asking. The `ask-user-question-logger` hook will remind you.

Define `RESULTS_DIR` = the resolved permanent folder. Define `RESULTS_ATTACHMENTS_DIR` = `${RESULTS_DIR}/attachments` (destination for materialized figures, distinct from the worktree-root `results_attachments/` that the analysis script writes to). Pass both as dispatch parameters.

### Dispatch the doc-writer

```
Agent(subagent_type: "superRA:implementer"):
  Stage: documentation finalization (Stage 2 RESULTS.md + project doc audit)
  Skills: superRA:report-in-markdown
  Domain references: baseline-io.md + rich-content.md + final-form.md (full mode)
  RESULTS_DIR: <resolved permanent folder>
  RESULTS_ATTACHMENTS_DIR: ${RESULTS_DIR}/attachments
  Stage 1 RESULTS.md: RESULTS.md (at worktree root)
  PLAN.md: PLAN.md (for objective, methodology, citations)
  Diff: <BASE_SHA>..<HEAD_SHA>
  Code files cited by RESULTS.md: [paths]
  Output files cited by RESULTS.md: [paths]
  Sub-parts (execute in order, commit each separately):
    A. Mature RESULTS.md in place, relocate to ${RESULTS_DIR} per final-form.md
    B. Audit project docs reachable from the diff (walk up to each CLAUDE.md /
       AGENTS.md / README.md from every changed file; always also check root
       README.md and root CLAUDE.md). Update stale claims, add new patterns,
       create missing CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md symlink pair for new modules.
  Additionally: Follow the standard stage-relevant workflow and load
    relevant skills and documents to proceed. Additionally,
    <optional steering — e.g., project-specific doc conventions, prior-round
    doc-reviewer feedback on a re-dispatch>.
```

The doc-writer is the only subagent in this step. It loads `superRA:report-in-markdown` full mode (SKILL.md + all three references) and performs both sub-parts before returning control.

#### Sub-part A: Mature RESULTS.md in place

Drive from `final-form.md`. The pass typically does:

1. Restructure from task-indexed to reader-facing — by objective, data source, or result type. Task numbering disappears.
2. Merge related findings split across tasks.
3. Strip resolved reviewer caveats; surface unresolved limitations into a "Limitations" section.
4. Add frontmatter per `baseline-io.md`. The file name stays `RESULTS.md` across stages — it is the identity of the artifact.
5. Materialize figures from `results_attachments/` into `${RESULTS_ATTACHMENTS_DIR}` per `rich-content.md`. Update embed paths.
6. Run the fact-check checklist from `final-form.md`. Open every cited file and confirm the claim matches. Strip speculation and subjective language. Remove prohibited sections (Recommendations, Conclusions, Implications) unless the researcher explicitly requested them.
7. Relocate: `git mv RESULTS.md ${RESULTS_DIR}/RESULTS.md` and `git mv` (or copy + remove) the materialized attachments folder into place.

Commit sub-part A separately:
```bash
git add ${RESULTS_DIR}/RESULTS.md ${RESULTS_DIR}/attachments/
git commit -m "mature RESULTS.md into permanent form at ${RESULTS_DIR}"
```

#### Sub-part B: Project documentation audit

For every file in the diff `<BASE_SHA>..<HEAD_SHA>`, walk up from its directory to the repo root and collect every `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `README.md` encountered. Always also check the repo-root `README.md` and root `CLAUDE.md` regardless of the diff (stale skill counts and top-level claims live there).

For each doc in the set:

- **Update stale claims** — command names, file paths, architectural notes, skill counts, any statement contradicted by the diff.
- **Add new patterns or modules** — if the diff introduced a new module directory, feature, or command, document it at the correct level (nearest CLAUDE.md to the new code, not blasted into parent docs).
- **Do not duplicate parent-level content** — link instead. Module-level docs should carry module-specific conventions, not repeat what repo-root docs already cover.
- **Create missing CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md pair for new modules** — if a new module directory has no guidance doc, create `CLAUDE.md` with purpose/conventions, then create a relative symlink `AGENTS.md -> CLAUDE.md` (just the filename, not an absolute path). If only one of the pair exists in an existing directory, unify them via symlink (keep the richer file).

Do **not** propagate upward for the sake of it: leave `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` above the affected area alone unless something in them is stale.

Commit sub-part B separately:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "update project docs for <analysis>"
```

### Dispatch the doc-reviewer

After both sub-parts commit, dispatch the reviewer:

```
Agent(subagent_type: "superRA:reviewer"):
  Stage: documentation finalization (Stage 2 RESULTS.md + project doc audit)
  Skills: superRA:report-in-markdown
  Domain reference: final-form.md
  Matured document under review: ${RESULTS_DIR}/RESULTS.md
  Project docs under review: [CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / README.md files touched by sub-part B]
  Source dev log (for comparison): RESULTS.md at <PRE_MATURE_SHA>
  Diff: <BASE_SHA>..<HEAD_SHA>
  Code files cited: [paths]
  Output files cited: [paths]
  Objective of the analysis: [from PLAN.md header]
  Additionally: Follow the standard stage-relevant workflow and load
    relevant skills and documents to proceed. Additionally,
    <optional steering>.
```

The reviewer loads `superRA:report-in-markdown` SKILL.md + `final-form.md` (and only those — per the skill's load-map for the doc-reviewer role). Scope:

1. **Matured RESULTS.md** — run the fact-check checklist line by line (`final-form.md`). Every cited number must match its source. Prohibited language, unsupported claims, and disallowed sections block APPROVED.
2. **Project docs** — accuracy against the diff, no stale claims remain, new features documented at the right level, no duplication with parent `CLAUDE.md`, CLAUDE.md ↔ AGENTS.md symlink convention respected.
3. **Cross-consistency** — matured `RESULTS.md` and any `README.md` / `CLAUDE.md` that mentions the analysis do not contradict each other (figures of merit, method names, sample sizes).

If REVISE: adjudicate per the orchestrator discipline above. For accepted issues, re-dispatch the doc-writer with specific feedback (file:line, what to fix). Re-dispatch the doc-reviewer. Iterate until APPROVE.

### Sub-part C: Dispose of PLAN.md (orchestrator, after APPROVE)

Once the doc-reviewer APPROVES sub-parts A and B, the orchestrator handles PLAN.md disposition directly — this is a user-facing decision, not an RA-implementable task, and it must not be delegated.

By this point `RESULTS.md` has graduated to `${RESULTS_DIR}` and project docs are in sync. `PLAN.md` is the only Stage 1 scaffold left at the worktree root, along with the working `results_attachments/` folder (whose content has already been materialized into `${RESULTS_ATTACHMENTS_DIR}`).

Ask via `AskUserQuestion` (plain text if unavailable) — this is a legitimate stop point. The default suggestion is Option 1 (move alongside the matured RESULTS.md):

```
PLAN.md is still at the worktree root and needs disposition. RESULTS.md
has already been matured and committed at ${RESULTS_DIR}, and project docs
are up to date. Options:

1. Move PLAN.md (and results_attachments/) alongside the matured
   RESULTS.md at ${RESULTS_DIR} — keeps the prescriptive history with
   the analysis code (recommended).
2. Consolidate any plan context into existing project documentation,
   then delete PLAN.md and results_attachments/.
3. Delete PLAN.md and results_attachments/ — git history preserves
   them on this branch.

Which option?
```

Log the researcher's choice in the `## Decisions` section of `PLAN.md` **before** executing the disposition (per `handoff-doc` §User Decisions Log). Include the log entry in the same commit that moves or removes the files — the last state of `PLAN.md` records what was done with it.

**Option 1 (Move alongside matured RESULTS.md):**
```bash
git mv PLAN.md ${RESULTS_DIR}/
git mv results_attachments/ ${RESULTS_DIR}/source_attachments/ 2>/dev/null
git commit -m "move analysis plan to ${RESULTS_DIR}"
```
The `results_attachments/` folder is renamed `source_attachments/` at the destination so it does not collide with the matured RESULTS.md's `attachments/` folder (which holds the materialized copies). Skip the rename if there are no figures.

**Option 2 (Consolidate):**
- Identify which existing project documentation should pick up plan context (data inventory, methodology rationale).
- Merge into existing docs (the researcher guides which docs).
- Remove the originals:
```bash
git rm PLAN.md
rm -rf results_attachments/
git add -A results_attachments/ 2>/dev/null
git commit -m "consolidate analysis plan context into project docs"
```

**Option 3 (Delete):**
```bash
git rm PLAN.md
rm -rf results_attachments/
git add -A results_attachments/ 2>/dev/null
git commit -m "remove analysis plan (preserved in branch history)"
```

## Hand-Off to merge-workflow

After Steps 1–3 are complete (drift tests committed, refactoring approved, all docs finalized via the doc-writer + doc-reviewer pair, and PLAN.md disposed of), invoke `superRA:merge-workflow` to update with main, run post-merge verification (drift tests + fresh integration review), and execute the local merge or PR push. Do not attempt the merge mechanics yourself — merge-workflow owns them.

## When to Lighten

**Standalone analysis (no existing codebase to integrate with):**
- Stage 1 (drift tests): Always run. Tests protect results regardless of codebase context.
- Stage 2 (integration review → refactor): Lighter pass -- focus on code quality and clarity rather than codebase convention alignment. Integration reviewer may APPROVE with no refactoring needed.

**Small changes (single-file analysis, few results):**
- Stage 1: Still run, but fewer tests needed.
- Stage 2: Integration reviewer may APPROVE immediately if code is clean.

## Handling Drift Test Failures After Refactoring

This is the critical judgment call in the process. When drift tests fail after refactoring:

1. **Identify what changed.** Compare the before/after values.
2. **Assess economic significance.** Is this a meaningful change in results, or a trivial numerical difference?
   - Point estimates shifting by more than the tolerance you set: investigate.
   - Sign changes or significance changes: always meaningful.
   - Standard errors changing modestly: usually minor (sensitive to implementation details).
3. **If meaningful:** Do not proceed. Show the user exactly what changed — before/after values side by side — and ask via `AskUserQuestion` (plain text if unavailable) whether to (a) accept the new result and update the drift test baseline with a documented reason, (b) roll back the refactoring, or (c) investigate the discrepancy further before deciding. Log the researcher's answer per `handoff-doc` §User Decisions Log before taking any action.
4. **If minor:** Update the test expectation, add a comment explaining why (e.g., "tolerance updated: refactored merge order produces equivalent result within floating-point precision"), and proceed.

## Agent Types and Domain References

Dispatched agents load a parent skill via the `Skills:` line and read a named domain reference by basename (the runtime announces the skill's base directory on load; the agent reads `<base_dir>/references/<basename>`).

| Stage | Agent | Parent skill | Domain reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stage 1 test creation | `superRA:implementer` | `superRA:refactor-and-integrate` | `drift-test-quality.md` (quality checklist) + `econ-data-analysis/references/integrate-drift-tests.md` (domain-specific framing: what to protect, econ tolerances, failure modes) |
| Stage 1 test review | `superRA:reviewer` | `superRA:refactor-and-integrate` | `drift-test-quality.md` + `econ-data-analysis/references/integrate-drift-tests.md` |
| Stage 2 refactoring | `superRA:implementer` | `superRA:refactor-and-integrate` | active domain skill's §Refactor integrity (data analysis: `econ-data-analysis/SKILL.md` §Review & Self-Check Discipline §Refactor integrity) + `codebase-integration.md` (cross-cutting code-quality) |
| Stage 2 integration review (code) | `superRA:reviewer` | `superRA:refactor-and-integrate` | active domain skill's §Refactor integrity (data analysis: `econ-data-analysis/SKILL.md` §Review & Self-Check Discipline §Refactor integrity) + `codebase-integration.md` (cross-cutting code-quality) |
| Step 3 doc-writer (matured RESULTS.md + project doc audit) | `superRA:implementer` | `superRA:report-in-markdown` | `baseline-io.md` + `rich-content.md` + `final-form.md` (full mode) |
| Step 3 doc-reviewer (final-form + project docs) | `superRA:reviewer` | `superRA:report-in-markdown` | `final-form.md` |

Step 3 sub-parts A (mature RESULTS.md) and B (project doc audit) are performed by the dispatched doc-writer subagent — an implementer-reviewer pair gates the whole documentation pass per workflow principle P1. Sub-part C (PLAN.md disposition) stays with the orchestrator because it is a user-facing decision, not an RA-implementable task.

Stage-driven domain-skill and script-to-notebook auto-loads are defined in the `agents/implementer.md` and `agents/reviewer.md` Stage tables (for data-analysis stages, those tables auto-load `superRA:econ-data-analysis` and `superRA:script-to-notebook`).

## Agent Teams Mode

When Agent Teams are available (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`), Stages 1 and 2 can be orchestrated as a team instead of sequential subagent dispatches. This enables direct iteration between creator/reviewer and integration-reviewer/refactorer without the orchestrator relaying messages.

**Invoke `superRA:agent-orchestration` for the Integration Team recipe** — it has the full team composition (6 teammates: test-creator, test-reviewer, refactorer, integration-reviewer, doc-writer, doc-reviewer), task graph with dependencies, iteration patterns, lead responsibilities, and session handoff protocol.

Step 3 (Documentation Finalization) can join the team as a two-teammate sub-graph: a doc-writer (performing sub-parts A and B) and a doc-reviewer, iterating on their own until APPROVE. Sub-part C (PLAN.md disposition) stays with the lead because it is a user-facing decision. The relocation-target stop point (Step 3 orchestrator preamble) also stays with the lead, since it fires before the doc-writer dispatches.

The lead handles user-facing decisions throughout (drift test candidates, meaningful drift escalation, RESULTS.md relocation target, PLAN.md disposition), commits at stage boundaries, and team cleanup after final APPROVE.

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Skip Stage 1 (drift tests) — they are the safety net for everything that follows
- Refactor before integration reviewer has identified issues — review first, then fix
- Remove data diagnostics, row counts, or validation steps during refactoring
- Judge the researcher's methodology choice — focus on implementation correctness (see the foundational RA framing in `CLAUDE.md`)
- Refactor before drift tests are committed and green
- Hand off to merge-workflow without integration reviewer APPROVE on the refactored code (Stage 2) AND doc-reviewer APPROVE on the matured RESULTS.md + project docs (Step 3)
- Skip Step 3 because "RESULTS.md is already a markdown file" — the dev-log form has not been fact-checked, restructured, or relocated, and shipping it as-is bypasses the discipline gate
- Perform the Step 3 sub-parts A and B as the orchestrator instead of dispatching a doc-writer subagent — this bypasses the implementer-reviewer pair that workflow principle P1 requires. Only sub-part C (PLAN.md disposition) is orchestrator-performed, because it is a user-facing decision
- Inline the Step 3 fact-check checklist or frontmatter spec in this skill — it lives in `superRA:report-in-markdown`'s `final-form.md` and `baseline-io.md`, and there should be exactly one source of truth
- Delegate sub-part C (PLAN.md disposition) to the doc-writer subagent — disposition is a researcher-owned decision, not an RA task

**Always:**
- Confirm key-result coverage with the researcher (via `AskUserQuestion`, logged per `handoff-doc` §User Decisions Log) before creating tests
- Run integration review before any refactoring
- Run drift tests after every refactoring change
- Re-submit to integration reviewer after every refactoring round
- Keep and re-validate all data discipline artifacts (describe steps, row counts, validation checks) through refactoring
- Dispatch the Step 3 doc-writer subagent with `superRA:report-in-markdown` (full mode — all three references) to perform the matured RESULTS.md consolidation AND the project doc audit in one pass; dispatch the doc-reviewer afterward and iterate to APPROVE
- Resolve `RESULTS_DIR` before dispatching the doc-writer — either from project guidance, or via `AskUserQuestion` if guidance is missing, logged in PLAN.md `## Decisions`
- Commit at each stage boundary and after each Step 3 sub-part (A, B, and C each land as separate commits)

**Drift-test integrity is governed by the cross-cutting rules in `refactor-and-integrate` reference `drift-test-quality.md` ("Drift Test Integrity — Cross-Cutting Red Flags") — failing tests must be adjudicated, not silently re-expected; tolerance bumps require justification; and test removal during refactoring is forbidden. Load the reference before creating, reviewing, or running drift tests.**

## Integration

**Called by:**
- **superRA:execution-workflow** Step 4 -- When the user chooses Option 1 (merge) or Option 2 (PR) after execution-workflow has verified reproducibility

**Hands off to:**
- **superRA:merge-workflow** -- For main update + post-merge verification + actual merge/PR

**Requires:**
- **RESULTS.md** (Stage 1 dev log) -- Source of key results for drift tests; matured into Stage 2 form at Step 3
- **Committed analysis code** -- Must be committed before drift tests are created
- **Reproducibility already verified** by execution-workflow Step 3

**Subagents should use:**
- The active domain skill (for data analysis: `superRA:econ-data-analysis`) — domain discipline auto-loaded at dispatch-time per the `agents/implementer.md` / `agents/reviewer.md` Stage tables
