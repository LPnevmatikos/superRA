name: using-superra
description: Master skill for superRA agents. Carries workflow principles, skill inventory, and the Stage → skill Load Manifest. Must invoke at the start of any superRA workflow (planning, execution, integration, merge) before dispatching work or touching handoff docs.

Loaded by all agents at dispatch time.

## Code-Change Defaults

These defaults apply whenever you write, review, or refactor code.

1. **Surface assumptions and ambiguity early.** Do not silently choose between materially different interpretations. State the assumption you are making, name meaningful tradeoffs, and point out a simpler path when one exists. Ask only when the ambiguity changes correctness, scope, or a decision that belongs to the researcher.

2. **Prefer the minimum code that solves the task.** No speculative features, abstractions, configurability, or defensive branches that were not requested. If a straightforward implementation works, use it.

3. **Keep edits surgical.** Touch only what the task requires. Match the surrounding style. Do not refactor adjacent code, comments, or formatting unless the task requires it. Remove imports, variables, and helper code only when your own change made them unused; mention unrelated dead code instead of deleting it.

## Runtime Workflow Map

SuperRA work moves through **PLAN -> IMPLEMENT -> INTEGRATE**:

1. `planning-workflow` creates or revises `PLAN.md` / `RESULTS.md`, records researcher decisions, and declares which task-local statuses or workflow rollups a plan change invalidates.
2. `implementation-workflow` executes task blocks through the implementer-reviewer loop, then verifies reproducibility and records the researcher's completion disposition before integration can begin.
3. `integration-workflow` protects key results, syncs and refactors against the integration base, matures documentation, and performs the final merge / PR / cleanup action.

The map is ordered, but re-entry is normal. A changed task, reviewer finding, scope revision, or interrupted session re-enters at the earliest invalid layer for the affected task frontier while preserving unrelated approved work. The main-agent Workflow Frontier Resolver adds four things agents must do consistently: inspect durable evidence, compute the affected frontier, route to the workflow that owns the earliest invalid layer, and enforce the non-negotiable gates before advancement.

## Commit Hygiene

Any agent that stages a commit — main agent, orchestrator, or subagent — stages **only the files it modified this turn**. Untracked files not your work (editor scratch, `__pycache__`, `.DS_Store`, harness artifacts, or other agents' in-flight edits in a shared worktree) show up in `git status`; `git add -A/./-u` sweeps them in silently and produces cross-agent commit contamination that is hard to unwind.

Before staging:

1. Run `git status` and list every modified/new file. For each, decide: did I touch this file (directly via Write/Edit) in this turn?
2. If yes -> stage it by exact path: `git add path/to/file`.
3. If no -> leave it untouched. Do NOT `git add -A`, `git add .`, or `git add -u`.
4. Before `git commit`, run `git diff --cached` and confirm only your edits are staged. If you see unexpected content, unstage it with `git restore --staged path/to/file`.

If you see unfamiliar uncommitted changes and cannot tell whether they are legitimate pending work (from the main agent between dispatches, or the user editing manually) or stale junk, stop and ask the orchestrator (if you are a subagent) or the user (if you are the main agent) — do not unilaterally discard or commit them.

## Handoff Docs

Every agent edits `PLAN.md` and `RESULTS.md` at some point — implementers rewrite step text and record findings, reviewers write review-notes blockquotes, orchestrators annotate with adjudication notes. The editing discipline (four document principles, inline-edit rule, stale-content checklist, User Decisions Log format, figure-embedding pointer, `## Project Conventions` layout, full `PLAN.md` / `RESULTS.md` anatomy templates) lives in `superRA:handoff-doc`.

## Skill Inventory

Grouped Workflow / Domain / Utility / Meta. See `skills/CATEGORIES.md` for the full grouping index.

| Category | Skill | One-line purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow | `planning-workflow` | PLAN phase: scope check, task decomposition, plan draft. |
| Workflow | `implementation-workflow` | IMPLEMENT + VALIDATE: per-task dispatch, one-pass review, reproducibility, completion menu. |
| Workflow | `integration-workflow` | INTEGRATE: Protect, Sync, Integrate, Document, Finish. |
| Workflow | `agent-orchestration` | Cross-stage dispatch patterns, Dispatch Templates, reviewer-feedback handling, Review Status Reference. |
| Domain | `econ-data-analysis` | Data-analysis vertical: Iron Law, describe-analyze-validate, pitfalls, common rationalizations. |
| Utility | `handoff-doc` | Handoff-doc discipline — four document principles, inline-edit rule, stale-content checklist, User Decisions Log format, figure-embedding pointer, full `PLAN.md` / `RESULTS.md` anatomy templates. Loaded on demand by agents that need the full discipline and always by doc-creators (planning-workflow Phase 2, integration-workflow Document doc-writer); usable standalone by a single author. |
| Utility | `result-protection` | Tools for protecting key results from unintended changes; drift tests are the current/default mechanism. |
| Utility | `refactor-and-integrate` | Tools for codebase coherence — convention fit, utility reuse, PR-friendly diffs, Project Doc Audit walk-up, minimum net diff — plus use of Sync impact as post-sync context. |
| Utility | `report-in-markdown` | Format discipline for markdown reports — figures, LaTeX math, tables. |
| Utility | `semantic-merge` | Tools for semantic coherence in branch integration — intent investigation, role classification, conflict resolution, stale-reference detect-and-resolve, propagation-to-coherence — with workflow sync author/reviewer mode references and standalone merge mode. |
| Utility | `worktree-data-sync` | Non-git data sync between existing worktrees (seed, diff, apply) and data teardown. Worktree lifecycle lives in `agent-orchestration/references/worktree-harness-fallback.md`. |
| Utility | `codex-superra-setup` | Generate and install the named `superra_implementer` / `superra_reviewer` Codex custom agents into `~/.codex/agents/` (global) or `.codex/agents/` (project). |
| Meta | `using-superra` | This skill — the master skill every agent reads. |

**Composable design:** Workflow skills own sequencing; domain skills own vertical discipline; utility skills are called on demand. One source of truth per concern.

**Harness adapters:** When this skill or its references mention a Claude-specific tool name (e.g. `AskUserQuestion`, `Skill`, `TodoWrite`, `Agent(subagent_type:)`), use the harness adapter reference before interpreting the tool name. 

## Execution Modes

For execution throughout the workflows, the main agent can dispatch subagents for implementation, or implement the step itself (Direct mode). Subagent mode is the recommended default and all workflows assume it. Main agents: see `references/main-agent.md §Execution Modes` for the full Direct mode contract.

## Skill-Load Manifest

For each Stage, load the listed skills. The Stage is role-independent; `subagent_type` (implementer vs reviewer) encodes role. Each loaded skill's own body carries its stage- and role-scoped reference load map — after loading a skill, follow its load map for your Stage and role.

**The "Required skills" column lists what loads *in addition to* `superRA:using-superra`** — the master skill every agent already loads (implementer / reviewer via frontmatter preload at dispatch time; main agent and team teammates via explicit `Skill` invocation). Subagents get a compact handoff-doc etiquette from `agents/implementer.md` / `agents/reviewer.md` and load `superRA:handoff-doc` on demand or when creating docs from scratch.

### Generic (stage-driven)

Apply to every dispatch regardless of domain.

| `Stage:` | Emitted by | Required skills |
|---|---|---|
| `implementation` | `implementation-workflow` | — |
| `drift-test` | `integration-workflow` Protect | `result-protection` |
| `integration` | `integration-workflow` Integrate | `refactor-and-integrate` |
| `documentation` | `integration-workflow` Document | `handoff-doc` + `report-in-markdown` |

`integration-workflow` Sync is branch-level and not a normal task-scoped manifest stage. It dispatches generic sync author / sync reviewer agents that explicitly load `semantic-merge` and the mode references named in that workflow. The canonical implementer/reviewer role specs do not carry Sync-specific exceptions.

### Domain add-ons (topic-driven)

If the task/topic matches a row below, load the listed skill **in addition to** the generic row for the current Stage. Domain add-ons compose with the generic table; they do not replace it. These apply to both the main agents as well as the subagent.

| If the task involves… | Also load |
|---|---|
| Economic / financial / panel data analysis — importing, cleaning, merging, filtering, constructing variables, summary stats, regressions (CRSP, Compustat, WRDS, etc.) | `superRA:econ-data-analysis` |

Add a new row when introducing a vertical (theory, literature review, simulation, writing). Keep the generic table untouched — only the add-on table grows.

**Main agents additionally load** `references/main-agent.md`, `superRA:handoff-doc`, and `superRA:agent-orchestration` before dispatching subagents or touching PLAN.md. Subagents skip these — they inherit context from their dispatch.

**Unknown `Stage:` values are a dispatch error** — halt and report to the orchestrator rather than guessing a skill/reference load.

## Instruction Priority

SuperRA skills override default system prompt behavior, but **user instructions always take precedence**:

1. **User's explicit instructions** (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md, direct requests) — highest priority
2. **SuperRA skills** — override default system behavior where they conflict
3. **Default system prompt** — lowest priority

If CLAUDE.md says "skip data description for this dataset" and a skill says "always describe first," follow the user's instructions. The user is in control.


**For main agents:** You MUST proceed to read `references/main-agent.md`.
