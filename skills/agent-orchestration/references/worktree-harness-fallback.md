# Worktree Lifecycle — Harness Tools and Raw-Git Fallback

Loaded by the orchestrator when it needs to **create**, **enter**, or **remove** a git worktree and no dedicated harness tool is available. Worktree lifecycle is an orchestration concern — see `SKILL.md` §Parallelization and Worktree Isolation for when parallel subagents require their own worktrees, and `skills/worktree-data-sync/SKILL.md` for seeding non-git data into an existing worktree (out of scope here).

## Prefer Harness Tools

If the harness exposes worktree-management tools (e.g., `EnterWorktree`, `ExitWorktree`, `CreateWorktree`, IDE-integrated worktree panels), use them. They handle cwd tracking, environment activation, and teardown more cleanly than raw git. Check the available tool list before falling through to the raw-git path.

## Raw-Git Fallback

### Create

```bash
git worktree add <path> -b <branch-name> <base-ref>
```

- `<path>` — absolute or repo-relative. Placement convention below.
- `<branch-name>` — new branch to create at `<base-ref>`. For orchestrator-managed parallel slots, use `<analysis-branch>/parallel/<slug>`.
- `<base-ref>` — typically the current analysis branch (`HEAD` is fine when already on it).

After creation, the orchestrator seeds non-git data via `skills/worktree-data-sync` §`--mode seed` if the task needs data access.

### Enter

```bash
cd <path>
git rev-parse --show-toplevel   # verify we landed where we expected
```

Agents dispatched with a `Worktree:` field are instructed to do this themselves (see `agents/implementer.md` §Before You Start).

### Remove

```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"/..   # step out if currently inside
git worktree remove <path>
git branch -D <branch-name>                # only after merge or explicit discard
```

`git worktree remove` refuses to remove a worktree with uncommitted changes unless `--force` is passed. **Never pass `--force` without first confirming `git status` inside the worktree.** Seeded data inside the worktree directory (including symlinks created by `worktree-data-sync --mode seed`) is removed implicitly when the directory is deleted; the source worktree's data is untouched.

## Placement

Priority order when choosing where to put the worktree:

1. **Project-level override.** Grep the repo-root `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` for a `worktree` directive (`grep -i "worktree.*director" CLAUDE.md`). If a path is specified, use it.
2. **Existing convention.** If `./.worktrees/` or `./worktrees/` already exists at the repo root, reuse it.
3. **Default.** `./.worktrees/<branch-name>` at the repo root.

Before first use of a project-local directory (`.worktrees/`, `worktrees/`), verify it is gitignored:

```bash
git check-ignore -q .worktrees 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT IGNORED — add to .gitignore first"
```

Global-location worktrees (e.g., `~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/<project>/`) need no gitignore entry — they live outside the project.

**Cloud-synced repos** (Dropbox, iCloud): prefer global-location worktrees — sibling-directory worktrees can conflict across machines.

## Gotchas

- **Clean state before remove.** Always `git status` inside the worktree before removing. An unclean state means uncommitted work is about to be discarded.
- **Branch deletion lag.** `git branch -D <branch>` only after the branch has been merged into its intended target, or the orchestrator has explicitly decided to discard. A parallel-slot branch that hasn't been harvested yet must not be deleted.
- **Detached HEAD on add.** If `<base-ref>` is a SHA rather than a branch name and `-b` is omitted, the worktree lands in detached HEAD. Always pass `-b <new-branch>`.

## Example Orchestrator Invocation

One parallel slot's full lifecycle (create → seed → dispatch → merge → cleanup):

```bash
WT=".worktrees/$BR/parallel/$SLUG"
git worktree add "$WT" -b "$BR/parallel/$SLUG" "$BR"
python3 skills/worktree-data-sync/scripts/sync_worktree_data.py \
  --from "$(pwd)" --to "$WT" --mode seed --seed-sync-mode force-symlink
# dispatch implementer with Worktree: <absolute path to $WT>
git merge --no-ff "$BR/parallel/$SLUG"
git worktree remove "$WT" && git branch -D "$BR/parallel/$SLUG"
```
